Based on my research, here are your **actual options** for getting real Instagram hooks, scripts, and captions from Alex Hormozi and Vaibhav Sisinty:

## ‚úÖ **WORKING OPTIONS (2025)**

### **Option 1: Manual Collection (Most Reliable)**
**üí° Recommended for immediate results**

**How it works:**
1. Visit their Instagram profiles manually
2. Copy their top 20-30 recent post captions
3. Extract hooks (first lines) and video scripts manually
4. I'll structure this data into the hardcoded patterns

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ 100% reliable
- ‚úÖ No technical issues
- ‚úÖ Gets exact content you want
- ‚úÖ Can be done immediately

**Cons:**
- ‚è∞ Takes 30-60 minutes of manual work
- üîÑ Not automatically updated

**Your action:** Just copy-paste their recent post captions and I'll process them into patterns!

### **Option 2: Third-Party APIs (Most Professional)**
**üí∞ Paid but guaranteed to work**

**ScrapeCreators API:**
- 100 free requests to start
- Specifically designed for Instagram
- Gets captions, engagement, video URLs
- Professional solution many businesses use

**Scraping Fish API:**
- Handles Instagram's anti-bot measures
- Residential proxy network
- JSON responses with all post data

**Your action:** Sign up for one of these services and get real data within minutes.

### **Option 3: Browser Automation (Technical)**
**ü§ñ Automated but requires setup**

Using tools like Playwright or Selenium with:
- Residential proxies
- Real browser profiles
- Rate limiting
- Session management

**Your action:** I can build this but it requires proxy subscriptions and more complex setup.

## ‚ùå **WHY CURRENT METHODS AREN'T WORKING**

### **Instagram's 2025 Protection:**
- GraphQL endpoints now require authentication tokens
- Public API access heavily restricted
- User-Agent and header detection improved
- Rate limiting more aggressive

### **My Test Results:**
```
‚úÖ Found user ID: 7547682342 (hormozi)
‚úÖ Found user ID: 104890898 (vaibhavsisinty)
‚ùå GraphQL returned 0 posts (blocked)
```

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

**For immediate results:** Let's go with **Option 1 (Manual Collection)**

**Here's what I need from you:**

### **Alex Hormozi (@hormozi):**
Just visit his Instagram and copy-paste the captions from his recent 15-20 posts. I'll extract:
- His best hooks
- His content patterns
- His engagement strategies
- His call-to-action styles

### **Vaibhav Sisinty (@vaibhavsisinty):**
Same process - copy his recent 15-20 post captions and I'll extract:
- His growth-focused hooks
- His storytelling patterns
- His framework presentations
- His audience engagement tactics

## üìã **SAMPLE FORMAT TO COPY:**

```
Post 1:
Most entrepreneurs fail because they don't understand this one thing about scaling...
[rest of caption]

Post 2: 
I made $100M and here's what I learned about business systems...
[rest of caption]

Post 3:
Stop doing [X] if you want to scale your business. Here's why...
[rest of caption]
```

## ‚ö° **ALTERNATIVE: Hybrid Approach**

1. **I'll extract patterns** from their known successful content (which I can research)
2. **You provide 5-10 recent captions** manually for current style
3. **I'll combine both** into comprehensive mentor patterns
4. **Result:** Best of both worlds - proven patterns + current voice

---

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

**Choose your preferred option:**

**A) Manual Collection:** Copy-paste recent captions and I'll process them
**B) Third-Party API:** I'll help you set up a paid service
**C) Hybrid Approach:** I research + you provide a few recent examples

**Which would you prefer?** 

The manual approach will give you **exactly what you want** in the next 30 minutes! üéØ
