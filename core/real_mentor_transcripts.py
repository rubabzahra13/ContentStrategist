The only thing that will get you rich is increasing your active income so that that's not the amount of money you're playing with.

Is that how this works? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so there's two paths to make money quickly if you don't have any. And the first path is go find the best entrepreneur and go work for them.
