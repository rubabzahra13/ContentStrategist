## 🛡️ Best Practices

### Mentor Selection:
- Choose mentors in your niche (AI, business, entrepreneurship)

- Analyze 50-100 posts for meaningful patterns
- Select mentors whose style aligns with your brand

### Course Content:
- Use high-quality transcripts from your best courses
- Include diverse content (strategies, frameworks, case studies)
- Add metadata for better organization
- Regular updates with new course content

### Pattern Analysis:
- Run pattern analysis after adding new mentors/content
- Review successful hooks and adapt to your voice
- Test different CTA styles from your knowledge base
- Monitor which patterns work best for your audience

## 🎯 Example Mentor Profiles to Consider

For **AI & Business Content:**
