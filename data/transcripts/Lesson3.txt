 Another often overlooked component in the world of TikTok and Reels is the text hook. Text isn't just about conveying information, it's about sparking curiosity, providing clarity, and setting the context in a way that compels viewers to keep watching. A text hook is a strategically placed, concise piece of text that appears at the beginning of your video. Its purpose is to instantly engage the viewer by presenting a teaser, a thought-provoking question, or a bold statement. This hook uses the power of words to create curiosity, inviting the viewer to dive deeper into your video. In an environment where viewers rapidly scroll through content, a compelling text block can be the pause button that stops them in their tracks. It ensures your viewers are instantly able to understand what you're offering, even if it takes a few seconds to explain verbally, which is often the case. Text blocks are especially useful when visuals alone might not convey the complete message or where additional context is necessary to fully engage with the viewer. Here are a few types of text hooks. Intriguing questions. Try posing a question that makes viewers curious about the answer. Questions like, ever wondered why or what if I told you can be extremely effective. Bold statements. Start with a statement that shocks, surprises, or challenges common beliefs. The goal is to create a moment of, wait, what? That compels viewers to seek more information. There's teasers and cliffhangers. Provide a snippet of what's to come, like, I can't believe he just did that, to build anticipation. Now let's get into a few examples of strong text hooks. We're going to start with this example of a video we shot for a local tourism board in a nearby city. This was only the third video ever posted to their account. Here's the hook. This guy looks like a local. Excuse me? Sorry to bother you, but I've heard that there's a spot where the locals go to watch a sunset, and I was wondering if you could potentially show me how to get there. That's why everyone's here. Yeah, time right now we could just go. We'll take it. That's a long hook. This text hook gave the additional context that convinced over 2 million people to watch the rest of the video. We utilized four out of five hooks in this video, but I want to really focus on why the text hook was important here. If we watch it back again and time this verbal hook out, it actually takes about 10 seconds for me to fully finish asking him the question. This is a prime example of when a text hook is absolutely mandatory. If we didn't give our audience this additional context, the moment the video started, they wouldn't have clarity on what was going to happen. But now they know what they're in for. And they're curious to know what the stranger is going to say, where he's going to take me, and what might happen along the way. If I had to guess, if we were to post that without a text hook, it probably only would have gotten maybe a couple thousand views. A lot worse than 2.1 million. Text hook. Now for another golf example. This next video is one of my favorites. It was so much fun to shoot and edit, and the response from my audience was absolutely phenomenal. This is my fiance, but today she is going to be my golf caddy. And if we can make par, I'm taking her to Mauricia to get anything that she wants. I'm in, but what's making par? So, would you watch the next four minutes of content? Because nearly 5 million people have so far. What made them decide this was worth so much of their precious time. What makes this video unique is that previously over 80% of my audience was male. But this particular upload was able to reach an entirely new audience of females, making up 51% of total viewers. So why did they decide it was worth their time? I think having the word girlfriend in the text block formed an immediate mental connection with that audience. Right away, they knew this was a video they would be able to relate with, because they could imagine themselves in the same situation. This convinced them to watch the entire four minutes and share it with their own partners. Thank you, text hook. Okay, now we're going to switch gears a little bit. This next video has received over 10 million views across various social platforms. This video had such a widespread impact that earlier this year, while I was on a road trip, 2000 miles away from home. A stranger walked up to me in a bar and actually started reciting the script back to me, word for word. Let's roll the clip. Do I drop a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. I know it does. What a t***. This is an example of a video that completely relied on the text hook. In fact, the entire honest ads channel relied on text hooks. If we hadn't provided that extra bit of context, people would have had no idea that we were poking fun at the brand, and probably would have just scrolled right on by. That's why text hooks are especially important in skit style content like this. They set the scene and provide expectations from the audience. Without these text hooks, the videos are incomplete. The reason I know why these text hooks are so important, specifically with the style of content, is because we've actually made similar videos for a client. And when they went to upload the video on their own, they forgot to include a text hook when they uploaded. And the video only got about 2000 views. Then on the next video, when they uploaded correctly with a text hook, it got 600,000. That is the difference between having a text hook and not. Now, if you were really paying attention, you would have noticed a few key similarities across all of these text hooks. And that is how they're formatted. The key here is making them feel like they're native to the platform that you're uploading on. For this reason, we always make sure that we add our text hooks when we're uploading the video on the app that we're uploading to. We see a lot of creators make the mistake of doing this within their editing software, trying to add a graphic design touch to it, sometimes using scripted fonts, but oftentimes these are really hard to read, and they don't feel native to the platform. This isn't a time to get fancy. It might feel boring just doing the same block letters and text every time, but this is what people are most used to reading, and it works the best for the individual platforms. The second part of formatting your text hooks is making sure that they're in an area that's easy to read, not getting blocked by any of the elements within the app, like the like and comment button, and also not blocking any key elements of your video, like the person's face. Your text should be short, impactful, and easy to read at a glance. Use strong, action-oriented words, and keep the design simple but visually appealing. Now you have perfected your text hooks, and it's time to move on to the next element. See you over there.
