 We are constantly being asked questions like should I be shooting on a DSLR? Do I need to buy lights? Or is my phone audio good enough? In this lesson, I'm gonna give you a crash course on when and why you should consider upgrading from your smartphone and building out your gear. For starters, I want to make it clear that even though we own hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gear, there's no limit to what you can do with just your phone. A lot of the time, we'll use our phone even when our camera setup is with us and ready to go. So why use a phone instead of a DSLR or a cinema camera? There are two main differences between your phone and a DSLR or a cinema camera. The first is dynamic range. This is a term used to describe how well the camera captures highlights and shadows. If a phone is shooting someone that's backlit, there's a good chance the background will be completely blown out. But if a Hollywood camera got the same shot, it would look more balanced. As you get more expensive in cameras, you upgrade dynamic range, making it possible to capture more details in the highlights and the shadows. The second largest difference is depth of field. This is a term for how blurry the background is, and it's the main giveaway someone isn't using a phone. This makes footage more cinematic and makes it feel more expensive when done right. We've found some clients still expect projects to be shot without phones. This won't necessarily make the content perform better or worse, but it's an expectation they have nonetheless. Lighting I'm going to give you a few key lighting principles that will make all of your videos look their best and help you decide what you need to gear up for lighting. Golden Hour Something magical happens when the light has to travel horizontally through the ozone layer, hitting all of the dust and water particles along the curvature of the earth. This creates such a soft, diffuse, even lighting on your subject. I want you to remember my passion for Golden Hour next time you're booking an outdoor content session. No matter how good you are, if you want your footage to look beautiful, it will make a world of a difference, shooting at sunset rather than in the middle of the day. Harsh vs. diffused An important thing to know about lighting is the difference between harsh and diffuse light. Harsh light is anytime a light source is hitting your subject unobstructed, like direct sunlight or overhead fluorescence. This type of lighting will cast unflattering shadows on your face. So how do you get the best balanced lighting? Make sure there's always something in between you and the light source, unless the direct sunlight is the look that you're going for. This can be shade from a tree, ambient light from a window, or having the light travel through a diffuser. More often than not, when we create our content, our big expensive light stay in their cases because manipulating daylight will look better and be so much easier. So if you're able to create content in a place where the light is diffused, good news. You're not going to need any lights. But if your content is all being created in a basement, I strongly recommend getting a light and a soft box. A soft box is essentially a diffuser like the one I just showed you that's built to go in front of the light. The more expensive lights you get, the tougher they'll be since they're made for big productions where they're getting tossed around. So keep that in mind when you're deciding how much to spend on lights. If they'll always stay in one place, you might be able to opt for a less expensive option. Here are the lights we currently use and the ones that we've used in the past. Currently, we use the aperture Nova. This is an RGB light, meaning it uses LED to create any color of light and it's filled with lighting effects. This is probably overkill unless you need colored light. We also use the aperture 600X, which is a bi-colored light, meaning that it can be warmed or cooled depending on whether you want it to match daylight, fluorescence, or anything in between. We also use the aperture 120 and 300D. If a light has a D at the end of it, that means that it will give you one color that matches daylight. For most content creators, this will be perfect because it essentially replicates the light that comes through a window naturally. You can find links to all of our lighting suggestions in the lesson description. There are three main lights called the key, fill, and backlight. The key light will be what illuminates your face the most and it should always be the first light that you consider and the only light if you can only have one. If the key light is placed directly in front, it's called beauty lighting because there are no shadows on your face. The further that light gets to the side, the more dramatic or moody it becomes. If you're doing makeup content, you'll probably want the beauty lighting. But otherwise, it's nice moving light to add a little bit of contrast to your videos. The key light will usually be your biggest window or come from the sun if you're not using a lighting setup. In this example here, the key light is what's hitting this side of my face. The fill light is what complements the key light. If you want to have contrast but you don't want it feeling like you're telling ghost stories, the fill light will even out the shadows. If you're not using a light setup, this will usually be the ambient light bouncing off of walls. The backlight can be used in a few different ways. In combination with the key and fill, the backlight will create an outline around you or the talent that separates you from the background. Usually you don't want to use only a backlight, especially when shooting with a phone. It can be easy for the subject to become completely black and the background to be blown out. That said, experiment with backlight, especially at sunrise or sunset when you can have the sun leaking out from behind the subject or do silhouettes. Whether you're creating content for yourself in your home or creating broadcast quality ads, these are the lighting principles that will keep everything looking its best. People see with their ears. An audience can forgive shaky or poorly shot footage, but if they can't understand what's being said, it's an instant scroll. If you're shooting selfie videos or everything is in a controlled studio setting in your home, you might be able to go your whole career with only your phone audio. But if the person talking to the camera is far away or you're shooting in noisy areas, it might be time to think about alternatives. There are two main ways to run audio for content creation. The first is using lab microphones. This is a tiny little mic that clips onto people's collars or bra straps that runs into a tiny box that records it or wirelessly connects to your phone or camera. I'll share a few that have worked for us, but if you're constantly struggling with not being able to understand what people are saying in your videos, this is going to be your best friend. My favorite is the DR10L because I can put it on to someone, hit record, and it'll be recording audio all day if it needs to be. This has been perfect for when I'm creating content for influencers on the fly, and I never know when they're going to turn to the camera and start sharing golden content. When you go to edit, all you have to do is synchronize the audio to your footage and it will sound fantastic. Khan's going to show you how to do this later on in our editing lesson. Another great option is the road go. I like that it connects directly to your camera so that you can monitor the audio and you always know that it's running. The second type of audio is boom mics. The audio quality is substantially better, but the mic is stationary unless you have someone committed to holding it on a boom pole. We use this when we set up long interviews or content where we're seated the whole time, like this. When we set up, you need a boom mic. We use the road NTG3, which goes into an audio recorder. We use the Zoom H6. We attach the mic to a boom pole and hook that up to a C stand. The Zoom H6 is also a great option if you're doing a lot of voiceovers and your content and want to improve the quality. Here is a quick test of the three audio setups so that you can hear the difference. First, this is what I sound like when I'm being recorded on my phone. Now, this is what it sounds like when I'm being recorded by the lav mic. Similar to the phone, but more appropriate if you can't get the phone this close to my mouth. And finally, this is what I sound like from the boom mic. One bonus tip is that hard walls or hardwood floors are reflective surfaces, meaning that sound bounces off them. And when sound is bouncing around a room, it makes it sound more echoey and less professional. So something that you can do if you want to have the best audio possible is to add some soft surfaces where possible. This can be a rug, a couch. In our case, I'm going to show you what our setup looks like. It's a little messy. It doesn't look like it doesn't behind me, but here you go. So we've got a blanket hanging from a C stand. We have pillows literally just thrown on the floor. But it sounds so good. Right? Worth it. In the past, we've actually literally created blanket for its just to do audio because it sounds way better. It doesn't look so stupid. Yeah, but it works, so it doesn't really matter. In the last notes, I put a list to all of the gear that we use and why, along with what we started with and budget alternatives. Now, in the next lesson, we're going to dive into shooting with your iPhone. Take it away, Meg. Take it away.
