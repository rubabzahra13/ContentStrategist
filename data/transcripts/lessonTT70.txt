 In this lesson, I'm going to be walking you through our ads manager back end and how to set up your own custom columns with the metrics that you want to see. So, let's dive. Okay, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to click on this drop down right here that says columns and you're going to go down to custom columns. This brings up this wildly overwhelming screen with thousands of metrics that you can track. And on the right hand side, you're going to see all of the metrics that are currently in your custom column preset. So let's go through what you want to be looking at. The first and most important metric is your cost per result, which is the same as your CPA. This is the metric that we follow the most closely and it's going to be your main guideline when you're deciding whether to increase or decrease budgets. Next is your daily budget and this is where you're going to be adjusting all of the budgets for your ads every single day. If you haven't already watched the penny method lesson, I want you to go back and watch that now because this is going to make a lot more sense after you do. So what you're going to see here is this ad here has had two bad days in a row, which means that tomorrow we're going to be lowering the budget for this one. These two had one bad day. So we're going to be monitoring them closely tomorrow. This one just had a good day. So we're going to be upping the budget for the next day and so on. The next metric that we look at most closely is the frequency, which is on average how many times someone sees your ad per day. As you can see, these are all pretty low. But if anything started getting close to a two, that might mean that it's reaching fatigue, especially if we're seeing an increased CPA at the same time. Next is your link click through rate. This is the percentage of people that see your ad and click on the button to go to your landing page. If this number is below 1%, it's a good sign that you should be creating more curiosity within your ad to encourage a link click and get people excited about taking the next step in your funnel. Next is your video hold rate. Now this is a custom metric, which is through plays divided by three second video plays. So I'm going to show you how to set up custom metrics. If you click on the columns drop down and you go to customize columns, you can click here on create custom metric. So this is what our video hook metric looks like. It's three second video plays divided by impressions, which you can do by selecting three second video plays in the drop down, hit the divide by and then select metrics. Make sure that you title it. You set the format to percentage and save your changes. Then the video hold is through plays divided by three second video plays. Same thing, name it video hold and format percentage. Give that a save and apply those to your custom columns. So your video hook column on the far right here is going to tell you how many people are sticking around past three seconds. So if this percentage is low, like say below 20%, you want to be thinking about how you can grab people's attention in those first few seconds and making them more curious about what your ad has to offer. If you're curious about how to do that, make sure you dive into the video ad academy and there's an entire lesson just on writing great hooks. Then the video hold if you're finding that this percentage is below 20, you want to be considering what's happening within the first 15 seconds that keeps people engaged with the ad. Okay, this is just a really high level overview of the metrics that we use and how to set them up, but feel free to use what you learn and set up your custom columns however you like using all of the metrics that they provide. The importance is having the data in a way that you can easily see and quickly make decisions every single day. So that is all for this lesson. I will see you in the next one.
