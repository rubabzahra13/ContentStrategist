 Every ad that you ever create is going to land on a scale in between entertainment and education, which we call the edutainment scale. Creating ads at Crush is a delicate balance. On the educational side of the scale, you're giving an audience all the information that they need to make an informed decision. But often these ads are dry and easy to skip past. A great example of this is TV commercials that take the 30-second slot to rattle off all the features of their product, giving you the urge to reach for the remote and change the channel. On the flip side, it can be hard to convert people to buy your product if you're focused entirely on the entertainment side of the scale. Without education on your problem or the product it solves, your audience won't have enough information to make an informed decision. A lot of the time, this takes a form of beautiful visuals that leave you wondering what the ad was actually for. So in this lesson, I'm going to be walking you through all of the types of ads on the educational side of the scale that actually convert. And in the next, we'll talk about all the ads that lean towards entertaining. I'll also be including links in the lesson description to some of my favorite educational style ads. So let's get into it. Before we dive in, something that is extremely important to remember when creating ads on the educational side of the scale is that your hook needs to be absolutely incredible. Nobody wakes up in the morning thinking, you know what I want to do today? See how a compostable phone case holds up to a plastic one in a drop test. So you need to give them a bulletproof reason to watch your ad within the first five seconds. We'll be getting into hooks later in this course, but I want you to remember that the more dry and educational your video is, the more compelling the hook needs to be. All right, let's get into it. First, let's start on the far end of the entertainment scale with the most educational type of ad. Number one is the knowledge gap. Some products require education to either teach viewers about the problem that it solves or the value that the product provides. For example, let's say you're selling a water purifier. Chances are your larger subjection is going to be, I don't need a water purifier. Tap water is great. So the fastest way to sell people on your product is to inform them how harmful the problem is. An example of a hook that would lead into that knowledge gap ad is, I just did a lab test on my tap water and you're not going to believe what I found. Then you would create a video educating people on the invisible threats that they're drinking every single day in their tap water. You might talk about how these threats are different in different parts of the world or share stats on how much chlorine the average person drinks in a year. I don't know what those stats are, but they're probably disgusting. By informing viewers of the problem that your product solves, you've turned them into a warm audience that's looking for your product. This makes it easy to position your product as the perfect solution. When done right, you're able to take someone who didn't even know that the problem existed all the way through the customer journey of discovering the issue, realizing that they need the solution and wanting to buy from you in just a few minutes. In some cases, you might be able to take them through the entire journey in a few seconds. Here's an example of a 10 second ad for a service that I bet would clean up. Ever wonder what happens if you don't clean out your dryer ducts? Click learn more to book a cleaning with us today. Within 10 seconds, you're introduced to a problem that you probably never thought of before, as well as the solution. I would make the ad longer and break down more objections, but that's probably enough to get a click and to get someone interested. An example of KnowledgeGap ads that we created for our course on organic content inform people about how the social media algorithm works, to challenge the belief that you need millions of followers to get millions of views. By educating people on how accounts can be created and get tens of millions of views with literally zero followers by getting a high watch time, we were able to shift their perspective. Suddenly, they understand a problem that has plagued them for years, which is getting 200 views on everything they post, and now they're invigorated to have found a solution. This style of ad doesn't need to be overly entertaining because people so badly want to fill the gap that you have introduced in their knowledge. A good rule of thumb is the more dry the subject matter, the more you should try to entertain the viewer. Right, that one down, it is so important. We always hear people say ads won't work for me because my product or service is boring. But take the water example from a minute ago. If you sat at a desk talking about how good the filtered water tastes, I doubt you could keep people's attention for more than a few seconds. But doing a lab test on your tap water to find out what's in it is a way more entertaining way to talk about the product. You can also provide more entertainment with engaging visuals or comedic script writing, which we absolutely love. Number two on the Edgetainment scale is the How To Add. This type of ad is especially important for any type of product with a learning curve. Whether you're selling an app or an appliance, fear of the learning curve can be a huge turn off for potential buyers. This learning curve can include anything from setup and first use to maintenance and disposal. The How To Add can be a great way to show them how easy your product is and help make it more approachable. A great example of how to ads comes from Tess's work with Lomi. Lomi is an appliance that turns your leftover food scraps into dirt. It comes with a lot of questions like is there a lot of cleanup? Do I have to do anything to the food scraps before they go in? How long does it take? Where do I put the dirt after? A simple How To Add showing the process of using the machine answers all of those questions and makes the product feel simple and approachable. If you're a service, the How To Add can outline your process. Let's say you're doing junk removal, dropping a bin off at people's houses to be filled and removed. People might have fears like whether the bin will mark up their driveway, whether they'll have to be involved in the drop off or pick up or what they can put in the bin. A How To Add can make your service feel more approachable because it helps people to wrap their heads around it. A lot of the time this type of ad is overlooked by entrepreneurs because they forget that things that are obvious to them as experts are sometimes scary to people with no experience with the product. Often you'll want to add entertainment value to these ads because they're inherently pretty boring. For example, a good format for How To videos is challenging someone to use the traditional way of something against your better solution. The first time someone ever sold a blender, it would have been an extremely intimidating appliance. Imagine someone telling you, you're going to have blades in your kitchen spinning thousands of times a second, pulverizing your food. But if you saw How To video, where someone with a blender is challenging someone else blending food the old fashioned way, like with rocks, I don't really know how they did it before blenders. But regardless, you could probably sell people on that solution in a few seconds. That leads well into the next type of ad, which is number three, comparisons. The best way to position yourself is the best option is to compare your product or service against the nameless competition. For example, when test was selling phone cases, she would do drop test comparisons against other phone case companies. When she also revealed that her solution came in 100 design options against the competition with five, and it was environmentally friendly against the competition that lasted 100 years in the landfill, her product became a clear winner. Comparisons are going to be a great way to capture people who are on the fence between your product and other similar brands. An example you might recognize is Dawn Dishsote, where they show a split screen with their product, kick an ass on this side, next to a mystery brand that's just spreading grease around, disgusting. A more modern example is athletic greens who put their powder supplement next to a messy pile of pills and vitamins, showing how their powder replaces a lineup of similar products. Another way to do comparison ad, similar to the how-to ads, is to compare your product or service against the traditional way of doing things. For example, if you're selling a mattress in a box, an effective ad could be comparing the process of getting your mattress in a box delivered on your doorstep to the good old days of strapping your brand new mattress to the roof of your SUV with duct tape and bungee cords and going 20 miles an hour down the highway so it doesn't become a 300 pound sale on the top of your car. Although you would be educating people on how easy your product is, you could probably imagine how that ad would have entertainment value. Number four on the educational side of the scale is the how it's made ad. If the biggest objection for your brand is the ethics around the production or build quality, it can be valuable to create ads that lift the veil and show customers how your product is created. If you're manufacturing in a factory, you can bring them along to see the process and if it's software, you can introduce them to the brains behind the program. Remember, this type of ad can get extremely dry so you'll want to find a way to keep people entertained while watching the ad. An extreme example of this is Ryan Reynolds with his ad for aviation gin, where he shows the process of creating the gin in an over-the-top way, with lines like the citrus fruits are misted using only the tears of aviation's owner, Ryan Reynolds. I've linked this example in the lesson description. It's definitely worth a watch. While there are hundreds of other educational ads you can create, this should get the wheels turning. All right, that is a quick overview on the educational side of the entertainment scale. Since your product or service is an absolute no-brainer in your mind, the goal here is to communicate what's in your head that makes you so sure. Below this lesson, we've included links to some of our favorite educational ads for inspiration. You'll notice they almost all include entertainment of some kind, but the clear purpose is to educate the end customer. As an activity after you watch those, I want you to brainstorm a list of potential talking points for each of the educational ads that I walked you through. If one of those gets you exceptionally excited, maybe that's the direction that you should take your next ad. While educational ads aren't always the sexiest, they can be the most effective at taking someone who's never considered buying what you're selling, all the way through the customer journey to purchasing your product. My challenge to you as you start to build out your educational ads is to have fun with it and find ways to educate people without them even realizing that you're doing it. All right, in the next lesson, I'm going to be walking you through all of the entertaining ads on the entertainment scale. I will see you in the next one.
