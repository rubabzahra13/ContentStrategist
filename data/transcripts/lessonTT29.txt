 No matter what your product, service, or industry is, there's an invisible wall that's stopping your ideal customer from buying. It could be the price, past trauma with a similar brand, or maybe they're just scared of what people would think if they bought a $300 hammock for their cat. If you want your ads to convert your number one job is to discover what stopping your customer from buying and help them to overcome those objections. Like a game of marketing jenga, you're going to pull it up until the tower comes down and the wall comes out, which is exactly what we'll be covering in this lesson. If you want people to buy your product, step one is understanding what stopping them, and it's not always what you think. In the 1990s, PNG launched from Breeze as a way to get rid of bad smells in the house, and it was a flop. But before they swept the entire project under the rug, they did some research to see why people weren't buying. They visited a woman living with her nine cats. The researchers said that the entire interview, they were trying not to gag at the disgusting smell in the house. Clearly, this was their ideal customer. But when they asked about the stench, she replied, isn't it wonderful? My cats hardly smell at all. People were so used to the smell in their house that they didn't think they needed for Breeze at all. They were trying to knock down the wrong objection. When PNG changed their marketing from get bad smells out of fabric to the finishing touch to a clean house, they went from a flop to literally a billion dollars a year in sales. If you want to scale your business, first, you need to understand what stopping your customer from buying and help them to overcome the objection. Another great example of this comes from Peloton. When you think of workout equipment, the first thing that comes to mind is a bow flex that turned into a dusty clothing rack. Since people are willing to pay practically anything to be healthy and have the body of their dreams, the number one objection for Peloton and nearly every other workout brand faces isn't actually price, even though it is expensive. It's the fear that it won't be used. For this reason, the majority of their marketing shows regular people talking about how they work the bike into their daily routines. They want people to know how easy it is to hop on at any time. So when their potential customer watches an ad with Shirley, who has four kids and still manages to squeeze in cycles, they're able to overcome the objection that they won't use it. They still have other objections like the price, the quality, and the results, but if they can convince people that they'll actually be able to commit to getting their sweat on every single day, hitting their health goals and having more energy, the other objections are going to fall like dominoes. This is an extremely important thing to remember. Although your customer will likely have several objections, in almost all cases, there is one thing that if you can convince them is true, we'll make the Django Tower fall. So how do you apply these lessons to your own business? First, you have to identify what the objections are for your product. I'm going to give you a list of all of the most common objections that people have when they're buying a product or service. Price. Is it worth what you're saying and can I justify spending that much right now, even if money is tight? Trust. I've never heard of this brand before. Is it a scam? Are people actually getting the results that they're saying they'll get? Is it cheap plastic that's going to break in a week? It's too complicated. People will often feel like a product is too confusing or too much work, and you need to convince them otherwise. What I have is good enough. If what you're selling replaces something the customer already has, how is your thing so good that it's worth switching? I'll do it later. If there's no urgency behind your product, your customer might put it off every single time they see an ad, especially if your product or service requires any effort. They could do this ongoingly for years without ever buying from you. Ethics. One of the largest objections for fast fashion companies is the fear that buying from them is fueling poor business practices. So for those companies, one of the best things they can do to help their customers overcome obstacles might be showing their ethical practices. Fear of making a mistake. As Khan talked about in the last lesson, one of the easiest ways to remove objections is to take the risk off of your customer by offering a guarantee. We'll talk more about that in a minute and don't worry, all of these objections are in your workbook. So if you want to refresh your hit the workbook and you'll see them in there. These are just some of the most common examples, but chances are the objections for your product or service have already popped into your head and you have a clear idea of the hurdle that you need to help your customers overcome. So what are the ways that you can get them there? The number one way to change someone's mind is always proof. When we launched our first course, we were telling people that they could get a million views organically on social media. And of course, the objection was, this will never work for me. They saw us with decades of experience and thought, of course you can do it. You've been doing this for years and you have a hundred thousand dollars in camera gear. The tipping point for that product was when we had a student who was 60 years old and had never posted a video in his entire life get 10 million views and 100,000 followers in a month after taking the course. Suddenly, we had hard proof backing everything we were saying and even better, people could validate the proof on their own by going to his channels. By sharing his results, we help people to overcome their own objections. They could say to themselves, okay, if he can do it, so can I. We'll be talking a lot more about testimonials in case studies throughout this course because it is one of the most powerful tools that you have to help people overcome objections and buy your product or service. A less powerful but still important tool is to show the way that you overcame your product's biggest objection. Let's say the objection is that your product won't work as well as you say it does. Showing your motivation for creating the product and the amount of work that you put in to make it what it is can help your customers to understand the value of your product. A third important tool for helping people overcome objections is through education on either the problem or your product. If you sell an air purifier, you can help people overcome the objection that it's not urgent by educating them on the harmful effects of unclean air. You can also educate people on the features of your product to make it superior to anything else they'll be able to find on the market. As we've discussed, a fourth tool that many of the largest brands in the world used to overcome any objection is a great guarantee. I once asked someone working at Costco about the weirdest return that they had ever seen and they told me, someone bought an above ground pool, used it for an entire season, then at the end of summer they hooked it up to their tractor, dragged it through a field of manure, threw it in the back of their truck and brought it right back to Costco. And guess what? They got all their money back. Now, you're not going to get many people taking advantage of your guarantee to that extreme, but you better believe I have spent so much money at Costco since hearing that story because I don't have to worry about whether I'm going to like the thing that I buy. Finally, one of the most valuable ways to overcome a price objection is by framing your product in a way that makes it feel free or even like it's making the customer money. For example, if I told you that this light bulb would save you $20 in electricity over the next year and I'll sell it to you for $5, would you take me up on it? You probably change every light bulb in your entire house. No matter what your product or service is, there's a way to frame it that reduces or totally removes the price objection. Overcoming objections is something that you're going to be working into every single ad that you create, whether it's your hero video or a UGC unboxing. So, I cannot stress enough how important it is to know exactly what's holding your customer back from purchasing what you have to sell. After this lesson, I want you to turn to your workbook and take 10 minutes to list every single objection someone could possibly have for buying the thing that you're selling. Then put them in order of importance and write down the buster for each objection. I've included some examples in there of how to do this as well. I challenge you to think as objectively as possible about this. Imagine you're someone who has never heard of you or your product and be brutally honest with yourself. Here's what this challenge might look like for a piece of work out equipment. Objection number one, I'm not actually going to use this. Solution? Here's surely who has four kids, two jobs and still gets on your exercise equipment 15 minutes before bed every night. If she can do it, so can you. Objection two, it's too expensive. Solution? A gym membership is $50 a month on average, so within 18 months, you'll actually be making money if you buy this. Objection, it's too big for my house. Solution, look how easy it is to fold up this exercise equipment and put it in the corner of the room. Objection, I think I'll do this later. Solution, for the next 48 hours, if you purchase, you can get 20% off with the code Evergreen. Plus, if you buy now, we'll throw in this cool bonus. You get the idea. If you want more examples, I put them all in the workbook, so go check them out in there. So, to recap, after this, you're going to write down a list of all the objections for your offer along with the best way to knock down that objection in your customer's mind. I want you to take this exercise extremely seriously, because later in this course, we'll be pulling the list of objections and objection busters out when we sit down to script our ad. All right, it's time for you to get to work and in the next lesson, Meg is going to help you define your audience. Bye.
