 A viral TikTok would probably flop as a YouTube video, and a world-class Netflix show would probably flop as a TikTok. Throughout this module we'll be sharing the styles and tools for creating content, but the most important thing to remember is to create content for the platform you're posting to. In the past, a lot of the value of a piece of content was put on the production quality. A beautiful ad of a girl using shampoo could have products flying off the shelf, because it was so inconvenient for viewers to find the remote and look for a channel with something good to watch for four minutes before their show came back on. Producers knew that their audience wasn't going anywhere, so there's no need to hook them in. They just had 30 or 60 seconds to leave an impression. That demand for high production quality has changed a lot. Some of the most viewed content from creators like Zach King are made with massive budgets, but are still shot to look like phone footage. The reason they do this is to make it feel more native to the platform they're posting to. No matter how you shoot your content or what you shoot it on, you just want to make sure it feels like it belongs where it's being uploaded. My first tip for this is to consume on the platform. This tip may sound obvious, but it's often overlooked by large brands. If you want to be successful on a platform, first you need to consume on it. You have to spend at least 10 hours scrolling or clicking thumbnails to find out what content looks and feels like on the platform. For example, on TikTok, you'll notice a lot of videos have quick moving subtitles, raw footage, fast cuts, trending audio, bright colors, long text blocks, pinned comments, the list goes on. While professional quality footage is more commonly seen on YouTube, I've seen a ton of creators work it into TikTok into reels really seamlessly. Since the content felt like it belonged on the platform, the addition of professional footage, light, or sound just made it stand out. Keep this tip in mind when the next platform knocks TikTok out of the spotlight. You can always be on the forefront of new platforms by consuming on rising apps. Where is the hook? The hook is hidden in different places depending on the platform, and it will change the way you edit your video. If you're on TikTok or Instagram, the hook has to be in the first 5 seconds. Since the content hasn't been searched for or clicked on, you have a very short window to prove to the person watching that it's worth their time. If you're on YouTube, the hook is in the thumbnail and the title. By the time the person clicks on the video, they're already hooked, and the challenge becomes retaining their attention. Even TV shows and movies have hooks in the form of trailers. It's important to know where your hook is for every platform because it will inform the edit. Watchtime. Something that has helped me a ton in creating content is assuming the only thing that matters is watch time. The hook should be so good that 100% of people make it past the first 5 seconds because they need to know how the video ends. After that, there isn't a single moment where people feel a lol or like there's no longer any value or need to keep watching. If you can do that, it doesn't matter whether you're shooting on an iPhone, $100,000 or a retro motor roller razor. We'll be talking a lot throughout this module about cameras, lights, and techniques for shooting or editing, but these are all just tools to enhance your story. On their own, without a creative idea, they'll just have you creating really pretty garbage. And decide what tools you need for your content. First, look at the platform you're creating for and decide what's going to tell your story best. Now that we have that out of the way, let's dive into the tools for the job.
