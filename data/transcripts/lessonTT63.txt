 Typically when someone first starts trying to run ads, it's a complicated, intimidating process. So in this lesson, I'm gonna pull back the curtain and explain how to take the stress out of media buying and stay cool as a cucumber, even when you're spending five figures per day. I promise, it won't be as scary as it sounds. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ A lot of people have the belief that meta and other ad platforms are out to get them, but I want you to look at it from a new perspective. The first thing you need to know about running ads is you and the platform have the exact same goals and the platform will do everything it can to get you sales. Think of it like this. The better you do, the more money you're gonna be able to spend on the platform. So if the platform can help you get mass sales for cheap, you're gonna have exponentially more to spend on ads and everybody wins. If you spend $1,000 and get nothing in return, chances are you're not gonna spend any more money. So it's in the platform's best interest to serve your ads to the right people and get you as many sales as possible. So principle number one is that you and the platform are a team and either everyone wins or nobody does. The next mistake that people make when running ads is they try to micromanage the account. I remember when I first ran my first ad, it looked something like this. Serve my ad to males between 18 and 25 years old who are interested in Gary Vaynerchak who work in social media, have a high income within Canada and drive a 2012 or newer suburban. I'm joking about the suburban, but you get the idea. For some reason, I thought that I knew who was gonna buy the product better than a platform that has data on people's web history, how long they've watched every ad for, what type of content they click or interact with, allegedly even conversations that they have in the privacy of their own home about things that they're interested in. I don't know if the last part is true, but I do know the algorithm has an infinitely better idea of who is interested in my product than I could ever hope to. Once you have your pixel or API set up between the platform and your website, it's gonna be tracking every detail about every person that sees your ad. Then when it finds someone who clicks, spends a little longer on an ad, goes to checkout or best case buys, it's able to find people who are similar to that specific person. Once you're doing this at scale, thousands of times a day, you're targeting based off of millions of data points that you can't even begin to guess or imagine. Think of it like fishing. Most people are going out, looking at where they see a fish jump, then parking the boat over that spot for the rest of the day, not realizing that they have access to a tool that knows every detail about every fish in the lake, including where they hang out and how hungry they are at every moment of the day. If this is new to you, this concept is gonna be worth the price of this course a thousand times over because the majority of people buying ads are still parking the boat, meaning that they load in a ton of targeting and reduce their audience size based on what they think is gonna work best. In the early 2000s, that was the only option, but people don't realize how powerful the algorithm has become, especially in the last decade. The other problem is when you park the boat, you'll fish that little area until there's nothing left, relatively quickly. And you'll need to find a new spot to move the boat, which adds exponentially more work to your plate and makes the performance less efficient while doing it. So instead of parking the boat based off a hunch, let the algorithm do the work for you. We have ads that have been running for over a year and still bring in thousands of dollars a day because the algorithm keeps finding new people to serve based off of their similarity to the most recent people who have bought. The platform is so advanced, it's also able to create a funnel out of all the ads that you're running to decide what the best first touch point is and what ad is most likely to make the final conversion. Even if you're starting completely fresh, the algorithm is gonna have a better idea of who your customer is based off of the data that it gets from your ad, ad copy, and landing page than your best guess ever will be. In David's words, the only time you should use interest-based targeting is if you're starting out and selling an extremely niche product, like accessories for Harley-Davidson bikes, where you can be confident that that interest will perform the best. But even then, you should still be running the same ad without targeting to see if it's actually better. I can't stress this enough. If you want to be successful with meta ads, you need to trust the machine. Let go of your ego and let it do the heavy lifting for you. We're currently spending $25,000 a day and the targeting is anyone and everyone on the entire planet. We let the algorithm take it from there and it does a great job. So right now you might be thinking, why did I just buy a course to tell me that I don't have to do any of the work and I can just let the platform do everything? Couldn't this have just been an email? Not quite. While platforms like meta have made it incredibly easy to run ads profitably, there are a few things that it can't do on its own. Most importantly, it can't run your numbers and decide whether your ads are profitable enough to increase your budget or whether you're losing money and need to work on the funnel. And that is exactly what Khan is gonna be going through in the next lesson. You're gonna love it.
