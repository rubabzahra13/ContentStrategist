 In this lesson, we're going to be talking all about tracking your ads both automatically using the Meta Pixel or API, as well as the good old fashioned way of using a Google spreadsheet. Having great tracking while running ads is incredibly important for two reasons. First, it helps Meta understand who your ideal customer is and keep finding new people who are similar to anyone who is bought in the past. And second, it's going to help you understand whether your ads are profitable and can scale, or if you need to work on refining your ads and offer. It is so important to have a clear picture of your cost per acquisition and how much you're spending on ads. So let's get into it. The Meta Pixel is a small piece of code given to you by Meta that you place on your website. This code lets Meta track user activity on your website after they click on your ads. This activity, otherwise known as events, can include actions like page views, items added to a shopping cart, purchases, form submissions, time spent on a page, and so many other things. When you have that data, a few things happen. First, Meta can target people who are similar to anyone who is bought from you, so you're only serving ads to the people who are most likely to buy. Second, you'll get a rough idea of how many sales each ad is getting from within your ads manager. While the tracking is never perfect, it will help you understand whether an ad is working or needs work. The next way to track people on your site is something called the Conversions API. In 2021, Apple released a software update with upgraded security and made the Pixel much less powerful for iOS devices. That is when the API was born because it skips past the browser data and sends information directly from the device's server. Now that might sound super technical, but basically the Meta Pixel works about half the time and the Conversions API works most of the time. In an ideal world, you should have both running at the same time. So how do you get them up and running? Every single platform that you could sell something on has a different way of integrating the Pixel and API. Typically, it's as simple as copying a code from Meta and pasting it into the back end of your website. But for every popular site from Shopify to eBay, there are a ton of resources on how to set it up. Just be patient with the process and remember that proper tracking could be the difference between breaking even and earning your first million dollars from ads this year. So it is worth the time and attention. If you find yourself getting stuck setting up the Pixel or API, there are a ton of people and companies that specifically support with tracking. You can find them on Fiverr or just give it a Google. Once you have that set up, you are going to be flying. But the Pixel and API are never going to track everything perfectly. That's why we're still going to keep a daily spreadsheet with our sales and ad spend so that we can understand whether we're in the green or we need to take another look at the funnel. So let's dive into what that looks like. You can find a link to the spreadsheet that we created in the lesson description and I recommend opening that now so that we can walk through it together. I've made this spreadsheet as simple and straightforward as possible. You have enough things on your plate already and the last thing you need is to spend an hour filling out data every morning. So let's go over what you will be doing every day in the spreadsheet. The first thing you're going to do when you get in here is update the exchange rate for your product. We live in Canada and sell our product in US dollars because in our experience, it's the most globally recognized currency. So I would put in a dollar 40 under the exchange rate. Hold down the bottom right hand corner of the box and drag it so that it applies for every sell. If you're selling in a different currency from your own, I recommend updating this monthly so that you have a really clear picture of what your revenue is after the exchange rate. If you're selling your product in your home currency, you can skip this step and leave it at one across the board. Also keep in mind that even though we sell our product in USD, we still run our ads in our home currency. So the only things affected by the exchange rate box will be the revenue and the refunds. Next, you're going to be adding in your total ad spend from the previous day. After that is your revenue for the day, then you'll add any refunds that were made that day. From there, you'll enter your costs associated with the sales for that day. You can get as granular as you'd like with this. If you're selling a digital product, it could be the daily cost for your software and office rent. If you're selling a physical product, it could be the manufacturing and shipping costs for the goods sold that day. And if you're selling a service, that could be the cost associated with labor for the amount that was sold. This box is completely at your own discretion. You can include as much or as little as you'd like to get a clear picture of your overall financial success from the ads. Once you do that, processing fees will automatically be applied to your revenue for the day. Standard processing fees through Stripe right now are 30 cents per transaction and 2.9% across the board. So I've set it at 3% to get a close idea. That said, feel free to add in the exact processing fees that you're dealing with. If you've updated the currency exchange rate, the revenue will also automatically be adjusted based on what you've entered. Now you're going to see your results for the day. The first number is Gross Profit. This is simply your revenue for the day, minus your ad spend and processing fees. Then beside that will be your net profit, which also subtracts your refunds and your operational costs. The reason I've broken it out this way is it's important to know what the biggest lever is to becoming more profitable. If your Gross Profit is great but your net profit is low because of a high refund rate, it's assigned to either make your product better or have better interactions with your customer after purchase to lower your refund rate. If your Gross Profit is below what you'd like, it's probably assigned to work on your ads and your offer. The next number on your spreadsheet is Row Ads or Return on AdSpend. This is a bit of a vanity metric because it's not actually how much money goes into your pocket. It's just how much money was spent on ads versus how much you collected from customers. So if you earn exactly what you spent on ads, you have a Row Ads of 1. If your revenue was $400 in a day and you spent $200 on ads, you would have a Row Ads of 2 and so on. Next to Row Ads is the ROI or Return on Investment. This number takes everything into account from your costs and refunds to ad spend and revenue. Our goal as a business is to keep this number as close to 100% as possible. At 100%, every dollar you spend on ads turns into $2. If this number goes significantly above 100%, and you have the capacity to serve more customers, it might be assigned to scale your ads up depending on where your sweet spot is for CPA. Then as you build this spreadsheet out, it's going to spit all of your totals into this sheet at the far end of the tabs on the bottom. The goal of this spreadsheet is to give you a high level overview of how your ads journey is going and to help you keep a finger on the pulse. If you weren't accounting for all of these numbers daily, it could be easy to think that you're raking in the cash when your cost of goods actually has you breaking even. Or worse. Ideally in the coming weeks, this spreadsheet will also be a source of pride because it'll show how far you've come and how consistent you've been able to make your business and profit from meta. So to recap everything in this lesson, first, make sure you have your pixel and API set up as well as possible using resources for your specific online storefront. You can contract out help if you need to and two, keep a detailed spreadsheet with real numbers so that you're never trusting what meta tells you that you've sold. And with that, you now know everything that we learned to take a little digital product from zero to selling over a million dollars every month on autopilot using nothing but social media ads to say that that knowledge is life changing would be the understatement of the century from personal experience. So in the next lesson, I'm going to give you a challenge and some final words to send you on your ad scaling journey.
