 In this lesson, I'm going to be walking you through the back end of our actual Kajabi and sharing all the features that have been totally game-changing for us. I'll be going over everything from how to set up your course to landing pages and check out to email strategy. So let's just get right into this. The first thing I want you to do when you get into the back end of Kajabi is go to products, then all products in the left navigation. This is where everything you sell lives from courses and downloads to coaching and paid community. We have nine main products that we offer, and this section will continue to build out over time as you expand your offerings. If you want to create a new product, you'll just hit the new product in the top right hand corner. It will take you through a few questions asking about your product, then you'll get sent to this page here, where all of your course content lives. Adding videos and content to the courses pretty self-explanatory, but Kajabi has a ton of really amazing walkthroughs for setting up each type of digital product if you ever do get stuck. I'll leave a link below to their tutorials in case you have any specific questions about how this works. Next if you click sales in the left side bar, you'll see everything from payments to affiliates. I'm going to show you what's most important from this section. I want you to start by clicking on offers. For every product that we sell, we have a number of offers. So for example, we have our TikTok and Rails creator course, and on this page it has three different offers. One is for our sales from our ads, one is for organic, and one is for email sales. We do this so we can track where traffic is coming from for each product. You can also create offers that bundle several products together. When you click on one of the offers, it will take you to a page where you can change the name and details of that offer. When you scroll down, you'll see the email automations connected to the offer. You'll want to set it so that when an offer is purchased, the person gets subscribed to a new email sequence automatically. More on that later in the course. You can also use this section to automatically add a tag to someone when they buy a course. So you can segment your list later, and unsubscribe them from other sequences that might be trying to sell them on the course. The next tab over at the top is pricing. This is where you can set the price as well as the payment processor. You'll have the option to use Stripe or Kajabi Payments as a payment processor. Both have the same fees, but we did an A-B test between the two, and Kajabi Payments won because it allows people to use Apple Pay, which is much more convenient. You should also make sure to set up PayPal because it will help you get more sales. We went with USD since we sell the course worldwide, and we find it's the most globally recognized currency. The next tab over is Upsells. This is where you can add any products you want people to see after making their purchase. You can share a video, a brief description, and they'll be able to add it to their purchase with just one click. You do not want to miss including these in your checkout. And lastly, you'll want to set up the actual checkout page for your offer. Just click the button at the top right, and you can customize this page. This is also where you're going to add your order bomb. You'll see a field come up where your customers will enter their information to purchase. We typically just ask for their first name, email, and credit card as it makes the checkout process super frictionless. We want it to be as easy as possible. Okay, next up, I want you to go to coupons in the sidebar under Sales. This is where you can create coupon links for your products. You can create 100% off coupons to test things out and make sure your checkout is working. And if you create a percent off coupon, you can click into it and hit the discount link button to copy the link and add it to the landing pages. So people get sent automatically to a page with a coupon already applied. Our next most used feature in Kajabi are the landing pages. So I want you to click website then landing pages. As you can see, we have over 160 landing pages in here. That's because we're constantly testing out our landing pages to make them better bit by bit. We find that the single landing page for an offer is way more important than the rest of your website combined. Usually people get sent to a landing page and decide to purchase without ever clicking into another page of your site. When you click into them, you'll find the editing is extremely intuitive. There's a ton of templated sections you can add to create literally anything you want. Kajabi has a ton of resources on how to use all of their website builder features so you can use the link in the description to dive deeper into how the landing page designer works. But I'm pretty confident anybody can get the hang of it very quickly. Next up on the left hand side, I want you to go to marketing then email campaigns. This is where all of your email broadcasts and sequences live. In the next two lessons, Meg will be diving deeper into email strategy and all of the sequences you need to have. But this is where you're going to find all things email, including email analytics so you can track conversion and all things performance. We find all of their email features super easy to use. But again, if you want to dive deeper into how any of it works specifically, the Kajabi tutorials are a really great place to look. Those are the main features that we're working on every single day to keep the ship running smoothly. The best thing about Kajabi is everything is super intuitive. So as soon as you get in there, it's all going to make sense as you go. Like we said in the first lesson, we wouldn't be where we are without Kajabi because it let us focus on the things that actually matter, which are getting people to buy the products and creating a course that will actually change their lives. While there are other email providers and checkout services that are marginally better, I think we would have given up before our courses took off if we were spending all of our time at the beginning figuring out how to integrate them and make small improvements before actually figuring out how to sell the course. Even now with over 120,000 students, we haven't felt the need to move our email or check out away from Kajabi. They continue to grow as we do and it really is the best all-in-one solution for course creators. Plus, since they have video walkthroughs on every single feature, it's pretty easy to do yourself without needing to hire web designers or tech support. Another section that's going to become very important as you grow your business is the analytic section. This is where you can look at overall revenue and refunds and also track specific offers. So you have a really good top-down understanding of which products are making the most revenue and where your customer lifetime value is coming from. If you're looking to eventually offer a community, a lot of people go the route of hosting on Facebook because it's the most simple. But Kajabi allows you to do a paid community right within the same platform that is as intuitive as Facebook and combines some of the best features from all of the other community hosting platforms, but allows you to do so in the exact same app. This is what our FON Your Peak Insiders community looks like and people absolutely love the layout of it. Inside the community, we host weekly group coaching calls. We have a video review channel and we also have one-to-one communication and group chats with all of our students. It really is the best community solution. What's great about the weekly group videos is after the session is done, if our community has missed it, they all live in a library that you can come through and watch forever. So we were actually able to integrate an onboarding system for new members to insiders where they can watch past lessons and get up to speed on what's going on in the community. I promise you're going to love this feature. So with that said, let's get into email strategy.
