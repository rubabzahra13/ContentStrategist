 At this point in the course, hopefully you're beginning to narrow in on a relatable, shareable, repeatable idea that you can begin creating to crush on the platform. In this lesson, I'm going to be sharing more specifics on creating that piece of content and elements you can incorporate to maximize its chances at success. I'll be going over some frequently asked questions on content creation and everything from gear to scripting to voiceover and people. The length. I get asked all of the time. How long should my video be? Stop asking me. I'm just kidding. Unfortunately, there's no one size fits all answer. Your video needs to be as short as possible and as long as it takes to get to the payoff at the end. A good rule of thumb is to remove any second of the video that doesn't add value or drive towards the payoff. You'd be surprised how quickly those unnecessary moments can add up. Value can be a laugh, something interesting, or a part of the story that's necessary for the video to make sense as a whole. If you can remove a moment of the video that doesn't contribute to the video landing, do it every single time. This also applies when you're scripting and shooting the video. Try to simplify as much as you can. If it feels confusing, it probably is. And if you can use five words to explain something instead of 10, it's probably going to perform better. The length is also usually dictated by the strength of the hook. If your hook is weak, you might only be able to get people to stick around for a few seconds. But with a strong enough hook, people will watch through a few minutes to get to the payoff. An example of this is a hook I used recently where my mom and I were standing in a golf simulator and I say, I'm going to see if I can beat my mom on a par five using only my gaff away. People were curious enough about whether or not I would actually be able to win that over half a million viewers stuck around for almost four minutes for the result. If I started that video with today, I'm playing golf with my mom. It probably would only justify a 15 second video because the hook is exponentially weaker, even though it has the exact same sentiment. Be roll. If you're not familiar with the term, be roll is supporting footage you put over the main video to help tell your story. For example, let's say I'm sitting here talking about an adventure I went on. Be roll would be the shots that I put over the video to visually show and explain what I'm talking about. Be roll can be pretty crucial for keeping people engaged and interested in your story and really helps drive home your point. Here's an example of how I use Be roll on my golf channel to show my travel time to Hawaii. Letting a stranger decide which course I play. What is the best whole golf you've ever played? Turtle Bay in Hawaii. The 17th hole. It's awesome. I got ocean and you got bunkers and it's just, yeah, it's the best. How'd you shoot? I had a par on that hole actually. It looks like we're going to go to Hawaii and beat this guy's score. I used just enough to give context that I was now in a new country but not too much that the viewer got bored and scrolled away. To keep your watch time as high as possible, which is what we want to do, you'll more than likely want shots to be moving along pretty quickly. And a lot of the time this is really tough to do without overlaying Be roll that you shot while capturing your video. Every time you're shooting content, I want you to think about what you could capture that would support the story and always make sure you're shooting more Be roll than you actually think that you'll need. It's better to have too much than not enough. If you're not able to shoot the content, you can also use images that you've either taken from the internet as well as stock footage. A quick note about this, if you're getting paid by a brand for a video, you'll want to make sure you're using footage or photos that you actually have the rights to so you don't get sued. We use a subscription service called Envato Elements for our stock footage and for photos, we use Unsplash, which is just a free stock photo website. Really awesome, would highly recommend. Here's what that looks like in context. Today, I'm trying to make par at one of the most iconic holes in golf. The number 14 movable floating green at Corde-Alan. We're probably going swimming. In the early 1990s, Dwayne Hagadone took an old sawmill in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and transformed it into a world renowned golf course featuring a lakefront driving range with floating balls and even a complimentary massage before your round. Voiceover, also known as VO. If you want to keep a narrative going throughout a video, a lot of the time of voiceover is the absolute best way to do it. You can either do this by recording a script completely separate to the video and underlying it throughout or you can record a video of yourself delivering the script to a camera. This way, you can cut back to the shot of you throughout, similar to a documentary and it'll help keep the video a little bit more engaging. Here's an example of recording a script and counting back to you speaking throughout the video. I just experienced the most adrenaline I have ever felt in my entire life because of this. This is a drone that goes over 100 kilometers an hour and because of these super cool goggles, you see what it sees. You can't see people pointing and laughing, so that's nice. After spending a ton of time in a simulator and crashing like 10,000 times, I'm not even exaggerating. I felt good enough to take it out into the real world. The first couple times, I took it pretty easy, but this morning, I decided to take it cliff diving. Voiceovers can either be scripted before you shoot the video and you can capture everything you need to visually show in the story or you can sit down with the collection of footage and figure out how it all connects afterwards. This is also your opportunity to add in more personality and videos with humor or a unique brand voice. We find it's always quicker and easier to have an idea of the script going into the creation process of your content so you can make sure you capture absolutely everything you need to on the day of the shoot. Text overlay. Similar to VO, text overlay can provide any context that would be missing otherwise. It can be a great way to introduce the hook and give context on why people should care about the video if you want to launch right into the actual content. Here are a few examples of what that hook looks like. We also almost always use text subtitles while they're speaking. This is both so people can enjoy with their sound off and eliminate any possibility that they can't hear what you're saying. While it's not entirely necessary, we've noticed better results when we are using subtitles in our videos, pretty consistently across the board. You can also use titles in your video to break it up. This is taking another common practice in documentary filmmaking. Adding a title can give context to where or what is happening in your video, like introducing a new scene, showing a new landscape, etc. Now let's talk about gear. This is a big topic of discussion. A lot of people sadly put off creating content because they don't feel they have the gear they need to bring their vision to life. It's very unfortunate and it happens really commonly. Even though we have tens of thousands of dollars worth of gear, a lot of the time we don't even touch it because the content will perform even better when shot on a phone. There are times when gear can help your video to stand out, but if it won't perform on a phone, I can almost guarantee it also won't perform on a cinema camera. Now one exception to this is audio. Your audio always needs to be crisp and clear no matter what. Most of the time you'll be able to get away with phone audio, but if you're in a place with intense background noise or maybe you need to be further away from the camera for the concept, you're going to need to think about audio. I would suggest lab microphones for these situations. Either DJI or Road Go are great options that can connect straight to your phone to give you crisp, clear audio in any situation. A lab mic will connect to a shirt collar or even a bra strap, not wearing a bra. If you want to keep it hidden and will dramatically improve sound quality, lab equals sneaky sound. Depending on the type of content that you're shooting, having labs could be the difference in usable or absolute garbage footage. Here's an example. We recently did a shoot at a driving range for my golf channel and between the road noise and having two people talking, myself and my coach, while being very far away from one another, it would have literally been impossible to get anything usable with a microphone on the camera. Since we were prepared, we got a number of great pieces of content from one single shoot, and this is something we do pretty frequently. A lot of the time we use microphones for our voice overs, but as long as the voice is easy to understand, this won't actually have any effect on the performance of the video. Post captions. The caption you put with your video is something you should absolutely never overlook. It's not just a spot for the hashtags and a throwaway line that you can just say, oh my god, it's a fun video, doesn't work. When people are watching, that's most likely the last thing they're going to see before deciding whether to scroll away and it can be a Hail Mary to hook them in. Use it as a spot to create more curiosity, extend on your hook or reference something at the end of your video. This can also be a spot to spark engagement in the comments. A great example of this is using a caption like, well, that was unexpected. If you think your audience is going to scroll away because they know exactly where the video is going, that might be the last piece they need to keep watching to find out what was unexpected about it. Scripting. We find it's always best going into your videos with the framework of the script that you can use as a guide while creating. If anything unexpected happens during the creation, this script should always be flexible, but it will give you a guideline to work with. At the very least, I would always recommend scripting your hook before you shoot the video. Shot lists. Shot lists are a little bit technical, but they're very crucial for having an effective shoot and especially if you're creating multiple videos at the same time. It can get super confusing without one. We personally love using a checklist in the notes on our phone. It's the easiest thing to do and we can just cross off the shots as we go. This helps us stay organized and on track without having to worry that we'll get back to and edit and be missing the most important pieces of the puzzle. This has happened before. It sucks. It requires a reshoot and you just don't want to be there. We typically just note down every single shot in sequence. So for example, wide of opening line, tight-on opening burger box, medium of second line, etc. from the beginning, all the way to the end of the video. Now it is time to take everything that you've just learned about creating, piece it together and come up with something truly brilliant in the edit. Glenn is going to tell you all about it. Let's go!
