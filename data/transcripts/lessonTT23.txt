 In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to do the quick change also known as the match cut, which looks something like this. This is one of our most requested videos and it's actually extremely simple. All you're going to need is your phone and a tripod and there are so many different ways that you can use this effect in your videos. So we're just going to dive right into it. Basically, all you need is a before and after of the same shot. So for example, I have Meg in shot number one wearing this outfit and in shot number two, she's wearing this outfit here. I want you to notice that she's standing in the exact same spot. Two shots that look almost identical except for what she's wearing. To show you what's happening here, we're just going to go through frame by frame so that you can see. So Meg says her line and at the very end of shot number one, she just tugs on her outfit. Now, once she gets to this point here, the next frame is going to be a similar shot, but she's wearing the other outfit and she's pulling the clothes away from her. So as you can see, when you go through frame by frame, it's really obvious that it's one shot and then another shot, but people aren't able to perceive that with their eyes that quickly. So when you play it all together, it looks like that. This same effect can be done by snapping. So for example, if she snaps at the end of shot number one and at the beginning of shot number two, it looks like she's just seamlessly changing outfits. Same thing for a spin. When she's halfway through the spin, you cut to the next shot, which is the same thing in a different outfit and put it all together and it's extremely seamless. Let's talk about a few ways to take this to the next level. The first thing similar to the other transitions that we've done is adding a sound effect like the WUSH and I'll put it in the downloads again. Basically, you just want to line that up right in between here and that little audio helps to connect those two clips and people's minds and it just makes it feel a lot better. If you're happy with how this looks amazing, stop the video here and you have everything that you need. But if you want to take it to the next level, I'm going to show you something just to make this look a little bit more believable. So you'll notice that right now, the shadows change in between these clips. And it's something that you may have not even noticed, but it would drive me crazy if I was watching a video. So I'm going to show you how to get rid of that. All you have to do is take any one of these clips and drag it on top. Now we're going to hit W and shorten this. We're going to make it the length of our clips here and we're going to go over top. It doesn't matter what she's doing here because we're only going to be using the background of this clip. Now what I want you to do is go to the color tab. We're going to right click here and we're going to go add alpha output. Now we're going to go to this blue box and we're going to drag it to the blue circle. Basically what this is doing is it's going to allow us to use the background and cut her out of it. So we're going to go over to this tab here, which has the circle with the four little dots around it. And we're going to click on this pen tool. After we click the pen tool, we're going to cut Meg out by clicking all the way around her like this. After we've clicked all the way around Meg, what we're going to do is we're going to come down to this square with the circle inside of it. We're going to click on that. Let me show you what we just did. If you go back to the original timeline and drag the clip over to the right here, you can see that there's now a cut out in the middle. So we are only using the background. We're not using Meg. But you'll also notice that these are extremely sharp edges, which is going to make this really obvious. So we're going to go back to our color tab and you'll see here there's a tab that says softness. So we're going to drag that up and that is what's called feathering. So that's making this line less sharp. Now as you can see, we're getting a little bit of Meg here. So we're just going to make that a tiny bit bigger. Now let's go back to our timeline and drag this. So it's over top. What this does is in between these shots, the background is going to stay the exact same while Meg on the inside can change. And it's just making it another 1% better. Now if I went to quick on that, feel free to hop back and just watch through it again. And after the first few times doing that, it's going to be completely second nature. And that is all there is to it. That is the quick changed or the match cut. You can use that to change your outfit to change location to show a room before or after being decorated. There are literally millions of ways that you can take this effect and apply it for different niches and different types of videos. And if you think of a creative way to do this, I'd love to see it drop it in the Facebook group and I'm excited to check them all out. That is all for this one and I will see you in the next one.
