 Welcome to the million dollar landing page Blueprint. Over the past few years, we have been obsessed with creating the highest converting landing page possible. So much so that we've spent over $6 million on ads AB testing our landing pages. Through that process, we've learned how to optimize and how to make landing pages more engaging and convincing for the customer, 1% at a time. So in this course, we'll be sharing absolutely everything we learned along the way and giving you the secrets that you can apply today that we've literally spent millions of dollars to learn. To give a bit of backstory, when we started our business, we actually offered graphic design and web development as a service. So we thought that our landing page had to be absolutely beautiful. We filled it with sleek graphics, fancy typography, and tried to make it look like a masterpiece. Then, little by little, as we ran tests to improve our sales, the landing page became simpler and simpler. Until it was mostly blocks of extremely intentional text and screenshots from our customers. Was it pretty to look at? Not really. But that didn't matter because the numbers proved it converted better. All this to say, you probably have some idea of what works and what doesn't already. But regardless of your experience throughout this course, I want you to be open to testing absolutely everything. Because early on, we thought having a 500 word essay right below our header was the dumbest thing we'd ever heard. But we decided to test it anyways. And lo and behold, it gave us a 20% increase in conversions. 20%, which means that change alone has brought us an extra $3 million since then. Not so damn any more, is it? That's an important lesson to remember. The key to a landing page that makes sales is to have an open mind. And again, test absolutely everything. In case web design feels intimidating to you, I want to set your mind at ease. Everything in this course is going to be easy to implement in any website builder. We use Kajabi for our digital products, and we absolutely love it. But anything from WordPress to Shopify will work great. And don't worry, everything we teach in this course is going to apply whether you sell digital products, physical products, or even services. So let's go over exactly what you're about to learn. Before you even start building a landing page, you need to have a slam dunk home run offer and understand how to position it to make it irresistible to your customers. If you nail this, people are going to understand exactly what the value of your product is within seconds of landing on your site. And you'll be able to make them feel extreme fomo if they don't take you up on it. So step one is getting crystal clear on your offer. Then we'll be taking you through our copywriting guide. Copy has been our secret weapon when it comes to creating high converting landing pages. Like we said earlier, we didn't think anyone would read a long block of text on a landing page, but the numbers don't lie. And high converting copy has made an absolutely massive impact on our business. So we'll be showing you how to structure your copy to get people's attention, keep them engaged, and build trust. After that, we'll be going through the five essential landing page types and how to make them as impactful as possible. We'll be walking you through creating a hero landing page for digital products, physical products, and services. Then we'll share two landing page types that we only see used by the most successful marketers in the world. When done right, the listicle and editorial landing pages build trust and desire in customers without them even realizing that they're being sold. These two landing page types are secret weapons to take your product from launch to your first million dollars. And we'll walk you through exactly how they work. After that, we'll walk you through how to make the journey feel seamless for customers from your ad or organic content to the landing page, checkout, and product. What many people fail to realize is just how important the relationship between your creative and your landing page is. For example, when your customer gets hit with an ad, the click to your page should feel like a smooth, natural progression that continues to answer their questions and gets them excited about your offer. If your ad creative is a Tinder profile, your landing page is the pivotal first date. You don't want your customer to show up for that date and not recognize the person they see in the picture. Consistency in the tone, language, and even color can have a massive impact on conversion rates because they make people feel like they're being led down the right path. And finally, we'll share the methods we use to generate traffic to our landing page and bring in over 100,000 customers by the end of our first full year with a new product. So if you're ready to take your landing page to the next level and use it to sell more than you ever thought possible, let's get this show on the road.
