 Congratulations on making it to this lesson. You've just officially joined an elite group of content creators. Before you move into the final challenge component of this course, I want to share something really important with you. Hear me out because if you don't understand the secret I'm about to share, there's a good chance none of the information is going to work to its full potential. Now how do I know this and who on earth am I? I know this because it happened for me. And in case we haven't met, my name is Jordan and I'm the director of coaching with 1P Creative. But a couple short years ago, I was sitting right where you are now. I was one of the very first students to take this course and win big. Let me explain what happened. In August 2023, I was pursuing my dream of playing professional golf, but I quickly ran into two issues. The first is that pro golf costs a bare minimum of $100,000 a year. And I was a good player, but these guys were really good. In a desperate search to find a way to generate income and build a brand for myself without giving up my dream, I was the 284th student to come through the TikTok and Reels creator course. Now I thought I knew everything there was to know about content creation, but after the two hours it took me to complete the course, I realized that there was a lot that I did not know. After consuming all of the lessons and taking a journal full of notes, I sat and I told myself this course was going to change my life. I allowed myself to believe that what I had just learned would make a major impact and set me on a brand new trajectory. And since I'm sitting here and not on a golf course, you can probably guess what happened next. They say change can't happen overnight, but for me, it did. Literally. I followed the formula step by step to a T, clicked publish and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning with over 300,000 views in less than 12 hours on one video, and it felt like I'd just won the lottery. Over the next 10 months, I built my channels from 0 to 20 million views, landed my first paid brand partnerships, and grew an audience of 35,000 followers without spending one dime on advertising. It gave me an unbelievable excitement for a career in content creation, because now I get to help students just like you every single day build their dream life with content creation being the vehicle. The course you've just gone through has the ability to set your life on a brand new trajectory that involves more money coming your way each month and more time to do what you want when you want with whoever you want. This is what we call living life by design and not by default. If you follow this formula, you will have the ability to say no to things that are not in alignment with your future and yes to things that you feel called to do. Now, just before you get into our 30-day challenge, I have an activity for you and I need to share a crucial piece of information that could have you crushing it by next week or allow you to become one of the statistical 97% of people who buy an online course and never finish it. And it all comes down to understanding why mindset matters. Now, I don't know you, but if there's one thing I do know about you, it's that you want more for yourself. How do I know this? Because you're watching this video right now. But as bad as you want things to be different, better, more exciting, there's another part of your brain that likes things just the way they are because, well, they've kept you alive up until now. See, even though new opportunities can be life-changing, your brain can actually see them as a potential threat or danger and will do everything in its power to keep you from stepping outside of your comfort zone and into the unknown. It's going to say things like, who are you to hit record and share your message with the world or you have no idea what you're doing? Please stop. Take this as a sign that you're growing. Don't see it as a negative. Like I said, your brain is designed first and foremost for survival, not things like tripling your income or becoming an internet sensation. So as you go along, if this resistance comes up, all you can say is thank you for sharing brain and keep following your dreams one small step at a time. Eventually, that voice will realize it has no power over you and you get to hit the unlock on the life that you have always wanted. Now, are most people living the life of their dreams? Not exactly. In fact, the statistics actually paint a picture that's quite the opposite. I want to ask you why don't most people get what they want? Is it because they're not talented enough, smart enough? Of course not. Most people don't get what they want because they don't know what they want. See what you focus on expands and because most people are constantly focused on what they do not want, they keep getting what? More of what they do not want. Because we can't hit a target that we cannot see, let's break down the life you've always wanted. It's time to decide exactly what that looks like in a super quick exercise. It's going to take you just a few minutes. You're not going to leave here with a two-do list. You're going to leave here with an already done and I can't wait to get started list. This isn't a what I think I might be able to accomplish exercise. That's the thinking that's keeping you exactly where you are. We're going to set goals that feel totally unattainable. Why? Because we've proven time it again that when you set a target beyond what you think you're capable of achieving, you start thinking and acting differently until you can become the person who can achieve those goals naturally. Remember, it's never about achieving the goal itself, but the type of person that you become along the way. When I set a goal of getting paid to make golf videos on the internet, it seemed utterly ridiculous. I had never made a single penny through content creation before, but sure enough, less than 60 days after I took this course, I developed the skills required to achieve that goal and landed a brand deal worth over $7,500. So whether you're an entrepreneur looking to sell a product or service, a solo content creator looking to work with brands, or you're in a marketing role and looking to impress the hell out of your team, it's time to create a big compelling vision for your future and write down the actions and habits that are going to get you there. I'm going to give you a super quick, super actionable three-step process that's helped me create everything from specific sums of money to first-class plane tickets to my dream car. It's simple and it works. Before I share it with you, I need you to know that everything is created twice. What do I mean by this? Means that before something becomes real in the physical world, it begins first as a thought. Think of your external circumstances, your health, finances, career and so forth, as a mirror to your inner world made up of your thoughts, beliefs and stories about the way things are. So if you want to change or improve some part of your life, simple as it may sound, it all starts with your thinking. As author T. Harve Eckers says, if you want to change the roots, you have to change the fruits. Ready? Step one is desire. This means getting crystal clear on your desired outcome. Want to grow your following? Cool. By how much? Want to make more money? Okay. How much more money? Because vague desires lead to vague results. Your brain is the greatest supercomputer that has ever been and ever will be invented. It's time we start using it to its full potential. We're going to do a quick visualization exercise to help you get crystal clear on exactly what it is that you want, followed by a short writing exercise in the attached worksheet. And if you're like visualization, yuck, hang tight. See that subconscious part of your mind that's responsible for your motor functions, heartbeat, growing your hair and nails and processing over 20 million bits of information per second. It does not know the difference between what is real and what is imagined. In fact, a man named Dr. Blas Lotto at the University of Chicago conducted a study on basketball players shooting free throws to prove the power of mental rehearsal by testing it directly against physical practice. Now the first test group was instructed not to touch a basketball or practice whatsoever for 30 days, not a very good recipe for improvement. The second group was instructed to practice shooting free throws for half an hour every day for 30 days. The third group was to come to the gym every day for 30 days, sit with their eyes closed and simply imagine themselves shooting free throws. The first group obviously showed no improvement. But here's what's crazy. The group that practiced every day showed a 24% improvement while the group that simply imagined themselves practicing came within 1% of the group that physically practiced every single day. Simply put, they got 23% better at shooting free throws in a 30 day span without ever touching a basketball. So let's try this right now in real time. Close your eyes, take a deep breath in and exhale. Let yourself relax completely. Now I want you to imagine that it's exactly one year from today. You are sitting somewhere peaceful, maybe your favorite spot in your home, a beautiful vacation destination, or a place that represents your success. Now as you sit there, you feel an overwhelming sense of pride, gratitude, and joy because this past year has been the most incredible year of your life. Think back on everything that has taken place. What are the goals that you accomplished? Did you grow your income, land some incredible opportunities, or travel somewhere amazing? Did you hit a personal milestone, create something life changing, or step into your most confident version of yourself? I want you to think about how much money is in your bank account or bank accounts. How does it feel knowing that you have complete financial freedom and security? Where are you living? Maybe it's that dream home that you've always envisioned. How does it feel to wake up there every single morning? Who are you surrounded by? What kind of relationships and friendships have you built over the past year? Who is with you celebrating your success? What is different? And most importantly, what is different about you as a person? How do you carry yourself? How do you think, act, and move through the world compared to who you were a year ago? Imagine yourself smiling because you've done it. You made the decision to go all in on your vision and you followed through. Allow yourself to rest in these feelings for a moment. Take a deep breath in and exhale. When you're ready, you can open your eyes, and I want you to write down three of the biggest things that made this the best year of your life. Those are your priorities now. This is a clear picture of your desired future reality. Experience right now in the present. So take a moment to pause the video and write down everything you experienced in the short exercise you just did using the attached worksheet, a piece of paper, or even the notes app on your phone. Hit pause now. I'll be here waiting for you when you're done. Great. Time for step two, which is turning on what I call your brain's hidden success switch. Since your subconscious mind can process over 20 million bits of information per second, could you imagine if it let all this information in at once and didn't filter out any of it? Your brain would literally explode. So in its genius nature, your brain has a mechanism called the reticular activating system, or RAS for short, that only allows in information that lines up with your belief system and what you frequently pay attention to. Now don't take my word for it. Let's try it out in real time. I want you to look around the room that you're in right now and notice everything that is brown. Brown, brown, brown, brown, brown. Now stop. Close your eyes. Precisely how many things did you see that were light blue? Unless you're the world's best multitasker, I'm going to assume that your answer is I have no idea. That's because your brain wasn't looking for light blue. In the same way, if this heat seeking missile in your brain isn't turned on for exactly what you want, it will keep defaulting to your old program and producing thoughts, feelings, and actions that are connected to the life that you've been living up until now. Time to give in an upgrade. Step three is immediate action. Because your brain is wired to keep you safe, not help you succeed, it's important to understand that immediate action is what's going to override that fear response before your brain and nervous system pull you back into your old familiar life. Without immediate action, a week or two are going to go by and you'll look around and notice that nothing's changed and your brain is going to go, oh my comfort zone, just where I like to be. Let's do our best to make sure things stay exactly the way they are for as long as possible. Speaking of immediate action, I have a special invitation for you. If you want to go to the next level alongside a community of heavy hitters, big dreamers, and renowned experts in their field, as well as direct guidance from myself, you can click the button right below this video and submit an application for the FYP Insiders Coaching program. It's a high level program and we don't accept all the applications we receive, but if it feels like a fit and you're done trying to get the results you want on your own, I would love it if you took a few minutes to apply for this program. I've helped students like Nathan go from 30 followers on his TikTok account to pulling over 100 million views and 300,000 followers in a six week period by following one key format. I've also had the privilege of coaching people like Chanel and incredibly talented artist and helping her go from struggling to crack 5,000 views to having a video pull over 8 million views and added hundreds of people to her print shop wait list. She also ended up landing an interview on Canada's largest media outlet on national television. These are the opportunities that great organic content can help you unlock. So as you continue to make your way through this course, keep your mind open to the endless possibilities that exist for you. Now keep on crushing it and enjoy the 30 day challenge.
