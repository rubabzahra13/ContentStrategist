 In this lesson, I'm going to be sharing with you the method that Navid used to scale our ads from spending a few hundred dollars a day to profitably spending five figures daily. It's called the penny method. Your ad campaigns are constantly going to be fluctuating up and down depending on how long the ad has been in market or even external factors like Christmas or a major election. So how do you know whether to ramp an ad up or drop it down? Here is Navid's easy and foolproof way of scaling ads. Every day, Navid adjusts the ad spend for each ad set inside our campaign depending on how it's performing. Doing daily changes is ideal for account spending at least a few hundred dollars a day. But if you're just getting started, it's best to use this method, adjusting every two to three days because the less you spend, the longer it takes to collect data on performance. For our ad account, he adjusts each ad set by around a hundred dollars every day. But if you're just getting started, you can use an increment as small as ten dollars. For the purpose of this example, I'll be using our account, but you can adjust these numbers to whatever you feel comfortable spending for your business. For example, rather than every day, it might be best to adjust the ad's every three days. And instead of a hundred dollars, you might prefer to do increments of twenty. So let's say he starts an ad with a hundred dollars per day. If the performance is bad and doesn't meet a requirements of fifty percent profits over a couple days, he's just going to turn the ad off. I suggest this starting point for testing a new ad to be around double your average order value. Because if your product costs a hundred dollars and you start at ten dollars per day, it might take a week for you to get a sale, but that'll still be a win. If the ad does perform well on day one, he'll increase the ad spend by a hundred dollars and one penny. So day two, the ad would be spending two hundred dollars and one cent. By increasing the ad spend by an extra penny, he's able to quickly and accurately see which ads have performed well the previous day. If the ad continues to perform well on day two, he would increase the ad spend by another hundred dollars and one penny, two three hundred dollars and two cents. So if the ad has been performing well for a week, the ad spend would be up to eight hundred dollars and seven cents. You would continue doing this until you saw the performance start to dip. Now let's say the ad has a bad day and the cost per acquisition goes above what you're comfortable with. You're not going to be reactive and shut it off or knock it down five hundred dollars because it could just be a bad day. Instead you're going to change the number after the decimal to ninety nine cents. For example, if an ad was up to eight hundred dollars and seven cents, but it had a bad day, you would update the budget to eight hundred dollars and ninety nine cents so that you know when you're looking at it the next day that yesterday was a bad day. If that ad has a second bad day in a row, you're going to drop the budget by a hundred dollars and change the cents to ninety eight to show that it's the second bad day in a row. So that ad set would now be at seven hundred dollars and ninety eight cents per day. On day three, if it has poor performance again, you can decide how much you want to lower it by. If the number is still hovering around your comfortable profitability, you could leave it. If you're losing money on the ad, you could drop it from seven hundred dollars and ninety eight cents to three hundred dollars and ninety seven cents. If your ad hits a point where increasing the budget makes it perform worse, but dropping the budget back down keeps it running in your sweet spot. You can just let it run at that budget, but keep checking on it daily to see whether anything changes for better or for worse. At any given time, we have around twenty five different ads running and Navid runs each of them through the penny method every day. But the same principles apply, whether you're running your first ad or your hundredth. One important note for updating your budgets is you always want to make budget changes or start running new ads at midnight. The reason this is so important is if you increase a budget or start running a new ad late in the day, Meta will often try to spend the full amount for that day in the remaining hours, rather than over a full 24 hour period. Basically it's also going to be at a significantly worse cost per acquisition. I know what you're thinking. You expect me to wait up until midnight every day? Luckily Navid has a workaround, which is setting the time zone of your ad account ahead to whatever is most convenient for you. So for example, he sets his time zone three hours ahead so that he can make changes at nine p.m. rather than midnight. But you can take this even further to whatever suits your lifestyle. When you're setting up a new ad, you also have the option of setting the start time and we always recommend just starting it at midnight. Now I know we just covered a lot, so if any of this felt confusing, I encourage you to watch through the lesson a few more times because once it does click, this method for adjusting your budgets is going to solve a million dollar problem for you. Like literally more like a 10 million dollar problem. Also, even though I threw around a lot of big numbers in this lesson, I want you to remember that you can do this at your own pace. If you're only comfortable raising budgets by five dollars when an ad is crushing, that's great. Do whatever works best for you. Alright, I hope you enjoyed that. In the next lesson, Khan's going to be walking through all of the most common roadblocks that you're likely to face and how to overcome them. Bye.
