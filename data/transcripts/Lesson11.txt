 In order to succeed as a content creator, you have to truly believe in yourself, and believe you can create life-changing content that will impact millions of people. I've met dozens of extremely talented creators who've missed major opportunities because they've convinced themselves in one way or another that it's just not possible. But we're going to make sure that that never happens to you, because you are unique. There's only one of you in this universe, and you have something truly incredible to offer the world. Now, if you're not ready to believe that just yet, you will be by the end of this video. This lesson could also be titled Life Hacks, because once you learn to develop an abundance mindset, it will truly feel like a superpower. In this video, we'll be using real-world examples to help you understand the power of positive thinking, and how we used it to build a foundational belief system destined for success. But in order to do that, we have to start by understanding the biology of belief. You might be familiar with this concept, but I'm going to give you a quick recap and a real-life example of the biology of belief in action. The best way to simplify the theory is this. We are what we believe. Every single thought that rushes through our head each day has the power to build or destroy your mental, emotional, and even physical world. This could be great news or terrible news. Let's start with the bad news. Example number one, the Koch Fiasco. Norman Cousins was the UCLA professor, and one evening, while he was in the stands at a university football game, somebody in his section got visually sick, projectile vomiting. Everyone was scrambling trying to get out of the way and call for a doctor. So the doctor rushes up and tries to figure out what is the cause of this sudden illness. As he's interviewing the patient, he doesn't find anything out of the ordinary. Thinking it could be food poisoning, he asks what the man is eaten. I just drank a coke from the Vending Machine. The man mutters. So the doctor figured, well, maybe there's something poisonous in the Coke. Maybe there's some kind of chemical that's linked to it. So in order to make sure no one else got sick, they made an announcement over the loud speaker. Please do not use the Vending machines. There is a chance you might get sick. Within five minutes, there were people puking everywhere. It got so bad that 12 ambulances were called to take people to different hospitals. About an hour and a half later, they confirmed there was nothing wrong with the Vending machines or the Coke. So they made an announcement and called the hospitals. Within an hour, everybody was well. This is how the biology of belief can work against you. Not only were these people led to believe that they could be drinking poisonous coke that would make them sick, but they also had a visual confirmation that it had already happened to someone. Further solidifying their fears and actually causing them to take on the same symptoms. The exact same thing can happen to you as a creator. Here are some of the limiting beliefs that you may have already adopted as a creator. I won't be able to make very much money. The creative market is just too saturated. This isn't a real job. I'm just not creative enough. If these are messages you receive often from yourself or the people around you, you're bound to start believing their true. And as you just heard, when you start believing something, it becomes your reality. Now for the good news. Example number two, Morris E. Goodman. When Morris was 35 years old, he was out for a solo flight in his airplane. Upon his attempt to land, he lost control of the plane, leading to a horrific crash. I know this doesn't really sound like a good news situation, but bear with me. With his neck broken, his spinal cord crushed, and every major muscle in his body destroyed, he only had control of two things, his eyelids, and his mind. As if Morris wasn't having a bad enough day, the doctors delivered another devastating blow. The severity of his injuries meant that he would never be able to walk or even breathe under his own power again. Morris had become a prisoner inside his own body. There was nothing he could do but think. And that is all he needed to do. Morris relentlessly visualized himself walking out of that hospital every single day. He never allowed a thought to come into his head that deferred him away from that goal. He replayed this visualization constantly until he slowly began to regain control over his body, bit by bit. And eight months after that fiery crash that should have been his end, he walked out of that hospital. Doctors didn't have any explanation, but Morris did. He says, man becomes what he thinks about. Our mind can make us physically ill, and our mind can allow us to overcome seemingly impossible physical barriers. So surely our mind can make us world class content creators. Now for an exercise. I want you to take the next 10 minutes to write a short list of core beliefs you're committed to developing over the next three weeks. These beliefs don't have to be based on numbers, but you should be able to visualize how they look and feel. Here's an example of a core belief our team adopted on a project for a popular Canadian country singer last year. We can be the best creatives in the music video space. Now one thing I should point out is that prior to this project, we had never shot a music video or worked with any artist. We just believed we could do it. So it became our mantra. We spoke about it daily throughout the production and believed in it so wholly that by the time the Canadian country music awards came around, we already felt like we had won an award. And then we actually did win. Music video when you connect a powerful belief to the work you put in each day, there was truly nothing that can stop you. Now it's your turn. Here's how this exercise works. Pull out your notebook and start by making three separate categories. Personal, professional, and financial. Now for each category, write down three positive beliefs you're committed to developing over the next three weeks. Try to get specific and write down how each of these beliefs will help you achieve your dreams. Once you've written them down, read them to yourself daily as a reminder of your true potential. I'll give you a few simple examples, but you should be more specific based on your desired outcome. Personal, if I'm not winning, I'm learning. With this, I'm reminded that there's no such thing as a loss. Each mistake provides a valuable lesson that I will use to do better next time. Professional. This is a career that will allow me to be the most successful version of myself. This belief reminds me that any definition of success is possible, from networking with my idols to impacting the lives of millions throughout my journey. And financial, there is no limit to the amount of money I can make as a creative. These beliefs should excite and embolden you and serve as a foundation to achieving your goals, which is exactly what we'll be talking about in the next lesson. I'll see you there.
