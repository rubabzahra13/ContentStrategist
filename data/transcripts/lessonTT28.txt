 Before we dive into the specifics that will turn your ordinary ads into conversion machines, we need to talk about the reason you're making these ads in the first place. Your customers. Without them, your product or service couldn't exist. They decide whether or not your business becomes the thriving, lucrative dream you've always envisioned, or goes the way of the Dodo bird. Broke, Extent, and only remembered for its lack of adaptability to a changing environment. Sorry Dodo. Although everyone's customer is totally unique individually, there is one constant which they all share. The customer journey. A journey that existed long before the digital world of landing pages and email marketing and will continue to exist long after. This is the journey from point A to point B, from introduction to purchase. A journey that every single marketer on Earth is responsible for guiding their potential customers through. And by the end of this lesson, you'll be the best damn guide on the planet. So, let's get after it. The easiest way to imagine the customer journey is by using an upside down pyramid, commonly referred to in the marketing world as a funnel. Your customer starts at the very top of this funnel and it's wide as section, and the goal is to move them down to the very bottom, as seamlessly as possible. Your funnel takes an audience from passively watching, to actively consuming, and purchasing. In this funnel, there will be three key stages that will be using to define the customer journey. At any given time, you'll have customers in each one of these individual stages, who are unsure how to advance to the next stage. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand exactly what these stages are and how you can move your customer down the funnel no matter where they are on the journey. Let's start with stage one. The first stage is the top of funnel, or problem and product awareness. This first section is made up of the general population of consumers. Many of them are actively interacting in the marketplace, unaware of a problem that plagues their lives. The goal in this first stage is to craft a message that introduces your potential customers to a problem. For example, I've been walking around day to day happily unaware that my beard is a little patchy, which apparently isn't very attractive to women and makes me look like a pathetic little boy. So recently, when I saw an ad that told me about this problem, I was obviously shocked and concerned about how this problem might affect my social status. Luckily for me, this wonderful company will call them Magic Beard Boost, had the solution, cutting edge technology that would open up my pores and allow for a thick and full beard. Magic beard boost used two huge emotional levers to bring my awareness to my problem. Mainly, they focused on my reduced social status and lack of sex appeal. Seeing this advertisement took me from being totally unaware of a problem and product into stage two of the customer journey. The middle of funnel or awareness and consideration stage. This second section is where your potential customers are now aware of a problem they have and they are actively researching solutions. This is where you want to assure your customers that your product or service is the absolute best solution to their problem. Bar none. Now that you've made them aware of the problem they're facing, it also means they're eagerly looking for a solution. It's important to make sure your brand is the obvious choice so your potential customers aren't finding a cheaper or easier alternative from one of your competitors. The best way to do this is to show them your product features and functionality. Proving to them that it works to solve their problem in the most painless way possible. Coming back to Magic Beard Boost, here's where they would show me the science behind how the product works, before and after videos from others who have used it to solve their scraggly facial hair problem in just a few short months and anything else that would educate me on the effectiveness of their product. If they've done this correctly, it will guide me into stage three of the customer journey. This is the bottom of funnel or decision stage. This final stage is where you convince your potential customers to fully trust your brand and pull out their credit card. At this point, your audience is aware of a problem and they're fairly certain that your product or service is the best solution on the market. But there's still something holding them back. So how do we get them to take that final leap? Let's talk about my patchy beard one last time. Now that I know how embarrassing my problem is and I've been introduced to a product that can solve it for me in a few short months, I just have one last question. How do I know this product will work for me? I'm unique. My genetics are different and I just can't be certain that this will work. Plus, if it doesn't work while I risk losing my hard-earned money for nothing, this is where Magic Beard Booster can use two of the most powerful tools in their marketing tool belt. Social proof and a bulletproof guarantee. Humans are very tribal creatures. We like to be part of a pack to feel as though we belong. We want to fit into a group of like-minded individuals. As Seth Godin, one of the greatest marketers of the 21st century puts it, people like us do things like this. So when I see raw, authentic videos of dudes just like me who used to struggle with patchy beards looking like lumberjacks because they bought Magic Beard Boost, I'm fairly convinced this product will work, but I still have a slight hesitation holding me back from buying. What if it doesn't? What am I putting at risk? How can I feel 100% confident in this purchase? This is where you can remove any risk and a version to buy in that your customer may feel with a rock-solid guarantee. For example, see a 50% increase in facial hair in 30 days or will give you a full refund and you keep the product. Having this type of guarantee can feel a little bit scary because nobody can really guarantee anything with 100% certainty and there probably will be a small percentage of customers who take you up on your offer and ask for their money back. However, from our experience, this small percentage is dwarfed by the number of conversions a killer guarantee adds to your funnel. There are a number of different ways to offer a guarantee and it's really dependent on what type of product or service you are selling. But here are a few examples of potential guarantees. The trial period. This allows your customer the opportunity to try the product and see if it fits with their lifestyle. A great example is the mattress company Sleep Country. Their customer's main objection is likely, well what if my new mattress isn't comfy? So Sleep Country offers a 100 night comfort guarantee. During this time they encourage their customers to sleep on their decision. By the time 100 nights pass there's a damn good chance they're not going to be sending that bed back. Happy customer? Happy brand. Next is Buy Now, Pay Later. This type of guarantee is becoming more commonplace with the introduction of companies like Clarna and After Pay, which allow your customer to split their payment up over a number of weeks or months. It can also totally remove the price objection because of the flexibility that it offers. Another advantage of offering payment plans this way is that if a customer misses a payment, the crediting company, in this case Clarna or After Pay, is responsible for collecting the funds, giving you the peace of mind and more time to focus on making the next guarantee is No Questions Asked. This is the boldest guarantee you can offer and I don't think it makes sense for everybody. Having this type of guarantee relies on having an incredible product or service and a ton of trust in your customer base. It's much easier to have this type of refund policy on a digital product because there are little to no cost of goods, meaning that you're only losing money on advertisement costs. Using our TikTok and Reels creator course as an example, our extremely lenient No Questions Asked Refund policy gave customers so much confidence that our refund rate actually dropped down to roughly 2%, which is well below the industry average of 5%. Also, because it's a digital product, we allow these customers to keep access, which has actually resulted in some of them buying from us again in the future, taking somebody who got a refund and turning them into a customer again. So now that you have a general understanding of how the customer journey plays out, you're probably beginning to realize that there are key bits of information each ad you make needs to deliver at just the right time and your customer's adventure down this slippery funnel of yours. While there are thousands of different variations of ads you can create for your potential customers, they'll all fall into one of the three categories of your funnel. Starting from the very top of funnel, where the majority of your potential audience of customers live. These are people who have never heard of your product and are probably unaware of their problem. If you don't create messaging to target this cold audience, you're ignoring millions of potential customers. They're onto the middle of funnel to educate them on why it's the best solution for the problem they face. And finally, bottom of funnel. To convince them beyond a shadow of a doubt that your product or service is perfect for them. Now, if you're thinking, oh my god, holy s**t, how unearthly am I supposed to know exactly where every customer is on their journey and making it specifically for each of them at the perfect place at the perfect time? What the s**t I got myself into? Oh my god, this is so overwhelming. Stop. I've got great news for you. You don't have to worry about how and when and to whom these ads get served for two reasons. Firstly, because the advertising platforms like Meta have an algorithm that does almost all of that heavy lifting for you and places your ads in front of the right people at the right time in their customer journey. How awesome is that? And secondly, because we're going to teach you exactly how to create killer, high conversion video ads for every step of your customer's journey. The ultimate goal here is to create an ecosystem of ads that target a broad audience at the top of your funnel and guide them through to a sale or conversion and one fell swoop. We're creating a 24 seven sales machine that takes passive scrollers on social media and turns them into happy paying customers. All you have to do now is make the ads. But first, we're going to pause to do a customer journey analysis for your brand. Before we dive into the exercise, I want to remind you that the customer journey doesn't truly end at the purchase. This course is going to teach you the skills to acquire customers. However, it will be up to you to retain them. Make sure that you have a thoughtful and intentional onboarding process for your customers that makes them feel valued and nurtured. Okay, now head to your video ad academy workbook and complete the exercise that we've included for this lesson. When you're finished, you'll have a roadmap for your ideal customers journey. So you know exactly how and where to serve them consistently. Once you've got that ready to go, we'll dive into our next lesson where Glenn is going to teach you about overcoming objections.
