 In this lesson, I'm going to be walking you through the digital product landing page that we have spent over $6 million dollars A.B testing with ads. Before I dive in, I want to reiterate something we mentioned earlier. We used to think that for landing page to work, it had to be a work of art. So we spent months making sure that it was filled with incredible imagery and branding elements, but as we spent over a year A.B testing absolutely everything, our landing page became simpler and simpler. Beautiful graphics were replaced with blocks of text because of a 20% increase in conversion, and the length used to be three times longer before we tested making it short and sweet. All of this to say, don't trust your gut. Be willing to test absolutely anything and everything. The platform we used for selling our course is called Kajabi and it has been life changing for us. It allowed us to scale to $10 million dollars with just three people working full time. So if you have a digital product and you're trying to decide what platform to sell it on, I highly recommend Kajabi. I'll leave a link in the lesson description for you to check it out. Kajabi allows you to do A.B tests, but if the site that you're building your landing page on doesn't allow you to do A.B tests, we've used a site called convert.com to do a lot of ours. We hired support to get it set up the first time and it has paid off a million times over. If you're not sure where to start, Google is going to be your best friend and you can use companies like Fiverr to find people to help you get it all set up. Okay, the digital product template in the download section is designed to sell things like courses, memberships, or downloadable content. And in this lesson, I'm going to be going through it section by section. The first thing you'll notice is the headline at the top. This is your one shot to grab attention so it needs to be short, punchy, and crystal clear. People should instantly understand what they're getting and why it matters. Think of this as the promise that your audience is desperate for. The headline for our course on social media growth is master, Instagram, Reels, and TikTok in two days, even with no experience. It might sound crazy, but we literally A.B tested every word of this headline and tried dozens of alternatives and you wouldn't believe the difference in conversion rates that this headline will make. This is by far the most important part of your landing page and getting it right could be the difference between breaking even or breaking a million dollars a month. Underneath the headline we have the VSL or the video sales letter. Video is incredibly powerful for building trust because it humanizes your offer. People buy from people they trust and there's no better way to establish that trust quickly than by showing your face and speaking directly to your audience. Your video doesn't need to be fancy. It's actually better if it feels authentic. Talk about the problem that your audience is facing, introduce the solution that you're offering and end with a crystal clear promise of transformation. We started out with an eight minute video here but found that a three minute cut down actually performed better. In the video ad academy we teach how to create a hero ad and this is actually a great place for that to live. When we tested a horizontal video sales letter against our vertical hero ad in this spot, the hero ad outperformed. So if you prefer you can swap these elements to match what we've done. Now let's talk about the social proof section. If you're considering buying something, what's the first thing that you do? You check reviews. You look for other people's experiences to validate your decision. That's why this section is so critical. You can include quotes, testimonials or even screenshots of real feedback from your customers. If you have a big name or a recognizable brand that's used your product, make sure to highlight that too. Since we've worked with a ton of big brands, we included them in our first social proof section which instantly boosts credibility. Moving down the page, we come to one of the most important sections. Your story. This is where you make an emotional connection with your audience. Share why you created the product, what problem it solves and how it's already changing people's lives. The trick here is to frame your story in a way that mirrors your audiences, struggles and desires. When they see themselves in your story, they start to believe that your solution is their solution. I thought there was no way a giant block of text would actually convert or that people would even read it. But I saw it consistently across all of the highest performing digital products on the internet, so we abtested it any absolutely crushed what we were running before. Don't underestimate this section and try to make it as engaging as possible. Next, you're going to put in more social proof. Try to make this section different from the first. If the first one was a trusted buy bar, make this one, messages that you've received with success stories or quick customer highlights. After that is your opportunity to show people what they're going to get when they buy. Try to build this section out as much as possible. It might be worth considering whether you can break your product into a main offering and a few bonuses to make it feel more valuable. We used Envato elements to download templates that you can edit in Adobe Photoshop, but you can achieve the same thing just using Canva. Make this section as clear and digestible as possible. Next is the offer. This is where you present your pricing for the first time and drive people to your checkout page. You'll notice that above this section, there are a few CTA buttons. Those should all take people down to this section on the page. Below that, we include the guarantee so that if people still aren't sold, we can push them over the edge. Hours is a 100% no questions asked satisfaction guarantee, but you can make yours anything you want. We've gotten more in depth into guarantees in the offer creation lesson, so make sure you check that out. Then, you're going to include even more social proof. You're probably getting tired of hearing me say it, but social proof will make the difference between people purchasing or not. You've probably gone on Amazon, seen something you really like, noticed that it only has three reviews and decided not to risk it. I know I've done that dozens of times. Do not underestimate social proof. Then, finally, you can finish it off with an FAQ or frequently asked questions. If people get to the bottom of the page and they still haven't bought, it's probably because some of their questions haven't been answered yet. This is where you can break down a list of objections like, is this right for me? Couldn't I just learn this on YouTube? You got the idea. Another powerful tool that most landing page builders include is a banner bar at the very top of the page that looks like this. It's subtle, but extremely valuable real estate to share information about things like sales or bonuses. Another quick tip that I love is using a service like Wiser Notify or Proof to have little popups come up that show when someone else has bought your product. It's like another form of social proof. I put a link to those in the lesson description for you to check them out. Those are the key elements that have gone into a landing page that has earned us over 10 million dollars for a low ticket digital product. I encourage you to use this as a starting point and just like us, a b-test absolutely everything. You should also start clicking on every ad for a digital product that you see and start looking through the landing page for inspiration that you can pull from. Although this blueprint is proven, every product and every audience is different, so you should experiment to find your own personal sweet spot. Also, if you're selling an info product and you want to learn about everything that we did to take our course from launch to over 100,000 students by the end of our first full year, I'll leave a link to our course on course creation below. And with that, I cannot wait to see your landing pages, and I will see you in the next one.
