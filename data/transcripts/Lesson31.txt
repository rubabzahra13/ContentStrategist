 Okay, now that you've figured out the tools you're going to use, it's time to start editing. In my opinion, this is the best part. It's where you finally get to see the vision you've been working so hard on come alive. And oftentimes throughout the edit, you'll find new ways to add impact to your video. Transforming it into something beyond your expectations. Let's make some magic. In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through our tried and true editing workflow, from organizing your footage to the final export. We'll talk about how to edit as efficiently as possible, so you can avoid mental burnout and truly enjoy the process. It's going to take a lot of practice, but once you've mastered this workflow, you'll be quicker than you say in bold and more calm than the Dalai Lama. To the editing station, welcome. You've just finished shooting. Your phone or camera is still hot with that fresh footage, and you are ready to edit. But before we do that, we have to get organized. If you're just joining us from the Adobe Premiere setup lesson, a lot of these first steps are going to feel very repetitive, so you can probably just go ahead and skip to this time marker. For everybody who's still here, I'm going to minimize into your bottom corner and share my screen so we can get rolling. Our very first step is importing footage. Getting that footage from your device onto our computer, organized, and ready to edit. As you can see here on Finder, I have a project folder. This one says 2022, which is where all of my projects from this year live, but I'm going to create a separate one just for this edit. So, the example we're going to be editing here is a video we just shot for our TikTok called Honest Ads, and it is about fast food, so I'm going to title this fast food. There we go. Now, let's jump into that folder and build it out a little bit further. The first folder I'm going to create within here is called CAM. This is our main camera folder where all of our footage is going to live. The second one I'm going to create is called Audio. For this folder, it's if we have any external audio that will be syncing with the camera or music or sound effects, it can all live in this folder. Those are the main two folders you'll need. Now, let's import. Open up your CAM folder and then open up a new window to find the device where your footage is on. For us right now, it's just sitting on a hard drive, but for you, it's likely an SD card or a phone. From there, we'll just take all of that footage, drag, and draw. Perfect. The folder is now set up and we're ready to get into Premiere, so let's open it up. From here, our next step, new project, title it, hours will be the same title, fast food. And then from there, you'll select your project location, which is the folder that we just created. Into projects, fast food. Now, it's important that we keep everything in this same folder because if you ever have to come back and make an edit later on, we want to know that everything is consolidated in the same space. There's really nothing worse than trying to open a project file and having a bunch of unlinked footage and not being able to work on the edit and instead having to go searching for all the pieces to put together. So by creating one folder where everything always lives, it's going to keep you so much more organized and so much faster. This is a crucial step and one of the most important things to remember when you're editing. Now that we've selected our location, we've titled our project, let's hit create. From here, it's going to bring you into the main Premiere interface. Our window is already set up for vertical editing. So the next step is to hit command-eye and import your footage. For us, we can just select the entire cam folder and hit import. There it is. Now you'll want to create your sequence. Go to file, new, sequence. We typically start using these RE sequences as a foundation because we find that they're most compatible across all devices and it typically looks the best. So scroll down and select RE 1080 23.976. From there, you can jump over to this settings tab. And right now, it's set up in 16x9, which is horizontal for TV, film, style viewing. Obviously, we're going to be editing this one for vertical social media. So what we're going to do is just swap that around and go 1080 by 1920. And we'll name our sequence main edit. Okay, our footage is in Premiere. We have a sequence set up. Before we jump into the main edit, I want to share our keyboard shortcuts with you. This is a really important step in being as efficient as possible in your edit. And in order to use these keyboard shortcuts, we have to start by installing them. But I'm going to walk you through step by step and make that very easy. Navigate up to Premiere Pro, select keyboard shortcuts. And from here, you'll see you have the Adobe Premiere Pro default layout. So what we want to do as a next step is hit save as and then title it something easy to remember like noodle. Okay, now that that's saved as a preset, it's going to be easy to find the folder where your keyboard extensions live. So the next step from there is open up finder search for noodle dot KYS. As you can see pops up here and show and enclosing folder. So this is the folder where your Adobe Premiere keyboard shortcuts will live. From here, all you have to do is download the one peak keyboard shortcuts that are included in the lesson description. So go ahead and download those. Take those from your downloads and drag and drop them into the same folder as your noodle shortcut. That's pretty much it. Now we can go back to Premiere, command S to save your project and then command Q to close just because it needs to restart to implement the new shortcuts. Reopen Premiere, reopen your project, go back to keyboard shortcuts. From this toggle, you should be able to find OP keyboard. Hit okay and then that will be your keyboard shortcut. And now we are ready to start editing and get our first draft in the timeline. So let's open up our footage. I usually like to shrink this down so it's just appearing in one row and typically I'll organize it as shot. Okay, so you already had a vision for this video. You wrote it out, you storyboarded it and you even created a shot list. So the very first step is to bring that vision back to life in your timeline. This means that we're going to get the very first draft as quickly as possible without any music, without any special effects, just the bare minimum of your vision and build it out from there. So that's the first step. Let's get back into it. What we're doing now is picking out the best takes from your video and putting them sequentially into the timeline. Start in with the very opener of the video, of course. For us, it's this wide shot here in the park. For our keyboard shortcuts, you'll use space to play, I to mark your endpoint and oh to mark your outpoint. You'll use those to select the clip that you want to drag into the timeline. So for me, I can see she's right about to start talking here. I'm going to select this as my endpoint and play through. Perfect, that's our first line. Let's drag this in. Now we have our first clip in the timeline. The next step if you used any kind of external audio recording is pairing your audio. For this video specifically, we recorded audio straight into camera so it wasn't an issue, but I'm going to show you exactly how to do that if we had been recording on an external monitor like a lab or an iPhone. Okay, so here's the clip with raw camera audio. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here never look quite as good. So it's pretty tenny. It sounds a little bit weird. Not the audio that we want. Now this audio track however. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here never look quite as good as we have. This was recorded on a boom mic and it's a lot more clean, a lot more crisp, whole sounding audio. So that's the audio that we actually want to use for this. Here's how you pair them. Select your video with camera audio along with the boom audio underneath. Right click, scroll down to synchronize. Click on synchronize and then you want it to be based on audio. So it might already be an eclipse start or a clipped end or timecode, but you want to make sure that you have audio selected because that is how we are going to pair the two. From there you just hit okay, it will automatically synchronize the wave lengths and then if you play it through. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here. That's both layers of audio stacked on top of each other. Now if I just select this layer that is the camera audio and turn it off, this will be paired just with the boom audio and sound like this. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here never look quite as good in the app. Perfect. So what I can do now is actually remove this layer of audio altogether because we're not going to use it. Drag this up and then you have video and proper quality audio automatically synced together. Takes very little time. Now let's get the second line in there. So the next line in the script is my character reacting to this statement from this fast food employee so I can just scroll up and find that. There it is. Toss that in the timeline. From there we go back to Meg's character. Here's the clip. In point. Out point. Drag that in. Which again we have more dialogue with my character so I will go back and select that line of script. That's all we need from there. That is the line. And then again it's a conversation with Meg's character. So back to her clip. That's my end point. There's my out point. Select drag and drop. At this point we have a cutaway scene to show the food photos being taken. So I know that's my next clip. There's where it starts. Perfect. A lot of the time it's okay to have a little bit of extra at the beginning of your clip and a little bit of extra at the end of your clip because as you go through you're going to refine and make these cuts a little bit tighter anyways. All we have to do from here is have our final line. There's our in line. Drag that in. Okay so from here what we have is the very bare bones first draft of our video in a way that makes sense. Obviously right now it's not going to feel very good because we haven't added any b-roll or any music or anything like that but we have the foundation of the script. So you should be able to watch this through and kind of get the point of the video. So I'll just quickly play it through now. All right we have a video. It's not great yet but the basics are there. You understand what the storyline is. You get the joke. Now it's time to make it better. Now that we've watched through that first draft in the timeline I noticed right away that there's a couple spaces where the pauses are a little bit too long and also spaces where we're stuck on one shot for too long and we should probably cut into a b-roll shot that we captured. So the next step is just tightening up those pauses and adding in our b-roll. So we'll go back to the beginning of the timeline to do that. In this first scene we also shot a supporting b-roll clip to cut into as she's opening the burger box. So let's find that and put it in where it makes sense. Here's a pro tip for making sure that your b-roll always feels smooth in your videos. This is going to take your video from amateur to professional really quickly. What we'll do for this step is go through the video frame by frame. What we're looking for is that first point where we start to see a little bit of movement as the box opens. In order to do that I'm going to use my left and right arrows to just move one frame at a time. Okay. There we go. We get a little bit of movement right there. As soon as you can see that little bit of space in the box at the corner right around here that's the first frame that I want to be looking for. So now we'll go into the b-roll and our source monitor and find the same frame where we start to get a little bit of that movement. Kind of right around there. You can do the same thing with the play head. That's where I start to really see a noticeable difference. So that's where we'll select our end point. Play that out until we have the burger fully open. Great. Now we have our b-roll clip. And what we're going to do with that is just drag it down to that same point on the play head where we started seeing movement before which is right there. For this clip we don't need the audio track. We only need the video to lay over top. So what you can do for that is select drag video only. Use the hand tool to just click on that and drag it down in. So now let's see how that plays in the timeline. To me it feels a little bit off still. I feel like we didn't quite get to see her opening it enough in the main frame. So what I'm going to do is just move that back a couple of frames. So what you can do here to nudge this clip over frame by frame is command and right arrow. That will move it frame by frame. And so what you can do is test just one at a time until it feels like it flows better. I'm going to start with two. That's starting to feel a little bit better to me. But what I'm realizing is I think I started this b-roll shot a little bit too early because you really don't see a quick motion until she gets to about this point in the box. So I'm going to delete that little bit of video and you can do that by hovering over the far left end of that clip and then just dragging this way. Okay as you can see that's a little bit out of place now. I'm going to drag it back this way. Let's see how that flows. That feels a lot better to me. The point of doing this is making it look like it was all shot in one action even though we actually used two separate shots for this. Okay so now we're just going to clean up that b-roll shot as you can see it overlaps our next shot here. So I'm just going to hover over that end point and drag it back to the end of this clip. And then I'm going to select the dead space here and just hit delete to suck the clips back together. Now as we move into this next clip you can see it takes about half a second for my character to have a reaction. In my opinion that's just too long for pacing especially on a platform like TikTok we don't want any of those dead spaces. So in order to delete that quickly find the point where I'm about to deliver my line which is right here and then we can just use the keyboard shortcut Q. What that does is it deletes the beginning of that clip and automatically burns the entire timeline right back to the edge. It's called ripple delete. Now let's quickly play that through for flow. Great that feels perfect to me on to the next. So we're vowing to change that. That feels like it flows through pretty quick. I feel like I like that so far it might change a little bit as the music comes but for now I think we can just leave it. Wow here's start making real quality food. That one I feel like can be tightened up just a little bit so just as we ripple deleted backwards before you can use E to ripple delete forward to the next clip just like that. As you can see I'm zooming in and out of the timeline. What I'm using to do that is just my trackpad so you can just scroll in and scroll out but there's also this bar down here what you can use to reduce and enlarge the size of your timeline. So I'm just realizing we're actually missing a clip here which is our star moment and the most important part of the video so we're gonna make sure we include that. So that is the billboard reveal that we were just taking these photos for. As you can see in this b-roll clip we use the footage that we shot in the studio to create a billboard and know we didn't actually buy this billboard advertising space just for a tiktok. In order to get the scene we took the images that we shot in the studio and tracked them on to a billboard that already existed in a program called Adobe After Effects but that is a little bit above this level and can be a completely different tutorial. Okay so let's select our endpoint. There it is that's the joke and let's drag it in here. See how that flows. Fast food. It took 30 seconds. What do you expect? Great that feels like it's suitable pacing and I feel like now we have the bones of a video. So the next step from here is refining and making it good. Now that we have the core of a video that flows and feels pretty good we're almost ready for the next step but before we do that we want to make sure all of our audio is at a suitable level. In order to do that we can go over to the Essential Sound window. Make sure all of the audio is highlighted. Select Dialog. Go to Loudness and then hit Auto Match. What this typically does is brings the audio volume to around negative 12 decibels. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here. Which is actually a little bit quieter than you'd want it to be on tiktok. Considering a lot of that is leveled to closer to zero decibels. So in order to stay safe and make sure nothing's clipping or overmodulated essentially that the audio doesn't sound bad. What I typically do is select all, hit G and then I usually like to add around six decibels which peaks at at about negative six. So just hit six and then hit Enter. Now all of your audio should be at a pretty suitable level. Remember look quite as you go to the end. The final step in making sure the audio is clean is listening for what's called an audio pop and as you're playing through your video a lot of the time on a cut it'll be part way through an audio track and you'll have an audible click or pop. So we're just going to quickly listen through for that. What? Right there. So what I'm going to do to fix that is zoom in, hold down Option and as you're holding Option you'll right click the cut point between those two audio tracks. This selects just the audio layers. From there you'll hit Apply Default Transitions which puts on something called a constant power and fades the two clips across one another resulting in just a smoother audio transition. Usually this doesn't need to be quite as long because it'll do something a little bit strange with the audio and have a bit of an overlap. So what I do is just make that almost the smallest size possible. Now we'll play that back one more time. Remember look quite as you go to the end. What? And as you can see there's no more audio pop. It just transitions smoothly. So before you get to the next step always make sure you go through all of your audio and remove any of those big clicks. All right that is the basic timeline cut together. Could we technically take this video and post it to Instagram or TikTok? Yeah we probably could. Would it get a couple of laughs? Potentially yeah it's pretty decent. Is it good? In my opinion no. So that's the next step. We're going to jazz it up. Add the music, the sound effects, the special effects, the text, the titles, all of the things that take it from okay to ha ha this is awesome. So that's what we're going to do in part two of this lesson. See you there.
