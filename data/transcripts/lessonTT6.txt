 In this lesson, I'm going to go over how you can build a community in the comment section by giving people something to talk about. Now this is important because the longer the viewer spends in the comment section, the better your watch time and the more TikTok is going to drive your content. I'm going to go over all the ways to create conversation in your comment section. Alright, the first is by doing something unexpected or polarizing. I'll explain this with an example on my channel. I recently posted about trying to hide chlamato juice in Glen's tacos, but that's not the unexpected part. While filming the video, a discussion came up between the two of us about how we could help drive people to the comment section. This is what we came up with. We decided to have Glen take the first bite from the center of the taco like an absolute weirdo. Without acknowledging it at all, and it worked. The post got over 600,000 views because everybody had to jump into the comments and make sure that they weren't crazy, confirming that he is, in fact, biting a taco in the strangest way possible. The comments about the taco bite are endless. People were shook. Now I'm not saying you should go out and film a video of eating a taco the wrong way, but I want you to know how important a tool creating conversation in the comments can be. Great engagement in the comment section is enough to make a video viral even on its own. So adding elements to your video that will really help take it to that next level is super important. So here's two ways to stir up conversation. The first is controversy. Controversy is everywhere, and you don't have to pick a side to stir up conversation in the comments. For example, on the One Peak channel, we created a video about Crocs and discovered that it is a wildly controversial topic. People either love them or passionately hate them, but both sides are eager to share their opinion. Another example is a video we did for Tesla, where we talked about the types of people who own a Tesla. Half of the comments were Tesla owners saying, I approve this message, and the other half was people saying how much they hate Teslas. Not a single comment was directed at us, because it was clear we were on neutral middle ground just making a couple goofy jokes. This is where you want to be. If you're going to create controversy, try to do it without picking or showing a side unless you're ready to take the heat. And I don't like that, it gives me anxiety. There are thousands of controversial topics, and if you can introduce them objectively, it can help drive conversation. When you're trying to stir up the comments, you've got to be ready for a little backlash though. The internet is unfortunately filled with trolls just looking to start a fight, and you need to not only accept but embrace the trolls. If you get a thousand comments on a video, chances are some of them are going to be negative. But don't let that discourage you. As humans, we have a tendency to see a thousand great comments and focus on the one negative one that ruined your day. But that one comment is in a reflection of you. It's a reflection of that troll. You can always evaluate to make sure the comment doesn't have merit, but they rarely do, and a lot of the time you won't even need to defend yourself, because other engaged audience members will do it for you. Next up is Relatability, the more relatable the concept is, the more people want to talk about it with strangers in the comments. You know that feeling when you finish watching a TV series, and you can't wait for someone you know to finish it, so you can talk about it with them? That's the feeling you want to give people with your content. Make it so relatable that they can expect there's going to be a community of like-minded people in that comment section, and they will build conversation off of each other, and help increase your engagement. There are channels that are completely based off this. For example, showing nostalgic products for people born in the 90s. There will be a 30-second video with just static images of nostalgic products, and everybody flocks to the comments to say how relatable it is, and see if anyone else feels the same way. Channels can be built entirely off building communities on Relatability, so it's definitely something that can't be ignored. Let's take our Honda CRB Honest Add as an example. Because it was specific and relatable to a niche of people who owned one type of car, the conversations in the comments were passionate about all the ways they use and abuse their CRBs. Providing your own opinion on a relatable topic will also stir up controversy and make people comment whether they agree or they disagree. We all have a dream car. But it's probably not a Honda CRB. We wanted something our good computing and it didn't really matter. It's kind of nice to just have a car you can ram f***** into. If you want to keep nurturing conversation, it's important to engage back with your audience as well. We find especially in the first 30 comments, it's important to take the time and craft responses that make people want to keep reading and hopefully keep engaging. For example, try replying to comments with the question. Using your brand voice to get cheeky or even just take the time to make people feel heard. If you can help make the comment section of your video in an interesting place, people will spend more time reading the comments and in turn push your video up the algorithm. And who the heck doesn't want that? No matter what direction you choose to go to stir up conversation in the comments, it's something you should always be considering in the planning phase of your content. So those are a few of the tips and tricks that we find useful when you're trying to create more engagement on your posts. May the comment and gods be with you.
