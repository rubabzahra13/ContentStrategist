 Welcome to part two of Habits. Now that you have chosen the most valuable habits to work into your routine, we are going to chat through how you can keep yourself accountable and actually follow through with them. I bet you can agree from past experience that developing a new habit is not an easy task. It's very common for people to start off strong when adopting a new habit, but after a few days start to lose a bit of that steam. In this lesson, I'm going to share a few tips on how to keep that momentum going and develop habits that will stick with you for a lifetime. And it all begins with clarity. For an action to become a habit, it requires consistency. And lack of consistency is the biggest reason that people throw their habits aside. But what if I told you a simple shift in mindset could help you maintain that consistency for good? Something I learned from James Clear, author of the book Atomic Habits, that really stuck with me is that it's not motivation that people need to stick with a new habit. It's clarity. Let me repeat that for the people in the back. It's not motivation that helps you stick with a habit. It's clarity. You might think your biggest roadblock is lack of motivation or having limited beliefs. Saying things like, if I only felt like going for a run today, or if I only had more willpower, when in fact, the answer is wildly simple. All you need is to have a plan of action. Instead of making in the moment decisions based on how you feel, figure out the when, the where, and how, the clarity, in advance for a higher chance of actually following through with that habit. I think this practice is best explained using an example. So one habit that I have worked into my daily and my morning routine is getting at least 45 minutes of exercise each day. Whether that be a gym workout, a hike, or just a walk through my neighborhood. Because I know that when I get those endorphins from exercising, I'm more productive at work, have a more positive mindset, but I'm also taking care of my body in the process. So let's break down how I give myself clarity to keep consistent with this habit. Beginning with the when. So when is the best time for me to perform this habit? Every night before I go to bed, I open my calendar and I analyze the next day. When, based on my schedule, can I commit to this exercise time? Sometimes it might be first thing in the morning, sometimes it might be on my lunch break. That part really doesn't matter. But the key here is to give yourself clarity. Tomorrow morning isn't enough clarity. Determine down to the minute when you will be performing that habit. For the sake of this example, let's say that my when is going to be 5.30 am. So now that I have my when, I move on to the where. Where makes the most sense for this habit to take place. Again, you need to get as clear as possible here. I might decide that the gym is going to be my where. And the final step is the how. And this is the super important part. How am I going to get to the gym at 5.30 am to exercise? It's important to remember that you want to try and eliminate as much of the in the moment decision making as you can. As that is going to give you the best chance of following through with a habit. And it's also going to help maximize your brain power in the process. I like to determine my how for each habit with a list of actions. Make sure to solve any foreseeable roadblocks that could stop you from performing the habit. Using the same example, here's what my how actions might look like. I might pack my workout here the night before, lay out my car keys, go to bed for 9 pm and step my alarm for 5.15. If I perform all of these actions, I have no excuse not to perform this habit in the morning. I have eliminated any in the moment decisions I could stand in my way. And if you do this clarity exercise for every single habit you want to perform each day, I promise it is going to be a total game changer for you. So now let's put this practice into action. Let's refer back to your list of daily habits that you made in the last lesson. And let's pick out at least 5 non-negotiable habits that you could realistically work into your daily routine to help you perform at your best. This list should be challenging but also achievable for you to perform every day. Be as specific as possible. Mine looks like this. 45 minutes of exercise, a 9 pm bedtime, journaling each morning and night, 20 minutes of learning, and drink 2 liters of water per day. Once you have this list every evening, you are going to give yourself so much clarity so you're able to perform each of those habits the next day. And do this by using the wear, the when, and the how method. This should only take you about 5 to 10 minutes. And if you have the determination like I know you do, this tool is going to transform your ability to follow through with your habits. And what's crazy is that this small commitment could very well change how successful you are in this lifetime. Remember, lack of motivation isn't your problem when it comes to habits. Instead, giving yourself clarity on how you can accomplish them. So let's sum this all up. The secret weapon to building strong habits that lead to success can be broken down into three simple steps. Analyzing your current habits, customizing your own 5 daily habits, and then using clarity to link the when, the where, and the how to your habits. Congrats! You have completed the first module of this course, Creative Mindset. I hope this has helped you understand the impact of the power of belief, the importance of goal setting, and how strong daily habits can help you achieve them. If you haven't done so already, I strongly suggest completing all of the exercises in each of the lessons before moving forward. So now that we have put in the groundwork when it comes to Creative Mindset, we are going to move over to the storytelling phase. Yes, we are ready to start creating that content. This is where we will share the importance of providing value, having a hook, sharing our brainstorm methods, and how to package your ideas so you can pitch them to members of your team or to a brand. Let's head over there.
