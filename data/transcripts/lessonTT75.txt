 So now that you know how to crush a digital product landing page, let's walk through how you can structure one for a physical product. You'll see this page used across a ton of product brands. I've looked some examples in the lesson description below of some I've worked with and some I just like. Check out those as references later. But first, this lesson will show you how to structure your high converting physical product page section by section. Let's start at the top, your product. The hero section should include high quality images or video. This is the first thing people see. So it has to quickly communicate what the product is and why they need it. I like to recommend a product carousel here, with the first image being clear and professional looking. It's also nice to add lifestyle imagery in here, like your product in use, for example, or a simple video showing movement. If it's luggage, you can show how smooth it rolls or how the handle comes up with a small sequence, keeping it around 10 seconds long. Or if it's a face mask, it can be a photo of how it sits on your skin with all the little specs up close. And if you want to get really fancy, you can add text to your carousel, whether that's value props, a punchy review, your main ingredients, or even a before and after. Brands can get hell of creative here. So take a look at the examples below and check out your favorite brands to see what they do. Next to the image is the product title, price, and a short paragraph that sells it. This copy should focus on key features, any objection busters, or a really good review. What does the product do for the customer? Why is it different from others they've seen? Handle the most common objections right away, whether that's price, quality, durability, et cetera. By the time someone reads this part, they should understand exactly what they're buying, how it fits into their life, and why it's worth the price. And do not overlook your ad to cart button. Make it pop. I've worked with designers that make the page super pretty and the ad to cart button matches the banner or the headline font. And it's really aesthetic, blah, blah, blah, no. Choose a color that's visible and easy to see. After that, we move into cross-selling with a you might also like section. This is where you show your top three to four additional products. These should either be your best sellers or items that naturally pair with the product above. The goal here is to increase your AOV or your average order value. Make it easy for someone to add another item to their cart without thinking too hard. Amazon does a really great job of this with their people who ordered this also ordered section that pops up when you add a product to your cart. Then comes the comparison section. This is where you show how your product stacks up against competitors. A side-by-side chart is usually the cleanest way to do this. On one side, list where the competition falls short. On the other, show how your product does it better. Keep the points specific and relevant to your buyer. No need to intentionally trash the competition. Just make your value clear and obvious. I also would avoid using real brands or logos here, just say versus the leading ex product or the leading competitor. Maybe with their color scheme, unless you're more of a ask for forgiveness not permission person, then you do you. Next, social proof. This is where you build trust. Pull in short, punchy reviews from customers, highlight testimonials before and afters or share screenshots of real feedback. Remember to keep the tone, human and authentic. This is so important. Also, preferably use real feedback, focus on messages that validate the product's benefits and address potential objections. People want to see that others like them have bought and loved the product. Make it a no-brainer that this product does what it says. If you have reviews on a trustworthy, well-recognized platform like Trust Pilot or Google, make sure you utilize those here to add an extra layer of credibility. After that, we dive into features. This is where you explain what the product is made of, how it functions or what makes it special. Use three to four key product features and break them down clearly. Visuals or icons can help you. You can design it beautifully or just keep it simple, whatever fits your brand. Just remember to keep the language simple. Step out of your brand for a moment and think about what the customer cares about. We'll have five-year-old understand these features. Don't get too technical or complicated with it. Once you've established credibility and clarity, we return to more social proof. This time, go a bit deeper. Include a longer review, a short user story, or even a transformation if that's relevant. Maybe this is where you feature quotes from an article or some reputable website. It feels repetitive, but some people do such a fast scroll. They may only be looking at visuals on your page. So show visuals as well as text for the research driven people. Seeing more people talk about the product, reinforces trust and encourages that purchase. Now you can bring in the brand story with a why we made this section. Keep it short and focused. You probably have another page on your website that goes into detail about your brand's mission or founder's story, so let's let that be the big explainer. Here, you can speak to the original problem that inspired the product and how your team created a better solution. Just the reason the product exists and what it was built to solve. If you personally struggled with the problem and now you're living life in the solution, visuals that support that are great. This creates emotional alignment and makes the purchase feel more personal to the customer. From here, wrap it up with a strong FAQ section. This is where you remove lingering doubts and address what most people are thinking. Think about the three to five most common questions you get about the product, whether it's shipping times, materials, usage, sizing, return policy, et cetera, and answer them clearly. You can also use this space to showcase your offer or guarantee and why it's a no-brainer to make the purchase. When done right, the FAQ session can reduce abandoned carts and customer service load at the same time. And that's it for your physical product landing page. Next up, Connor is gonna walk you through how to structure a service landing page. If you feel it's irrelevant and want to skip that one altogether, I recommend checking out the next lesson on Listerco landing pages. It's a very common format that can convert like crazy when done right. See you in there.
