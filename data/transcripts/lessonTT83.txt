 You've decided on your slam dunk home run speedboat course offer. Now you have a choice. Do you run a pre-sale before you create it and see if people buy? Or do you build the whole thing first and hope you can sell it? In this lesson, I'm going to break down the pros and cons of each as well as which direction we prefer. So let's start with option one. Running a pre-sale before you build out the course. A lot of course creators recommend doing this because it's impossible to know what a market is going to think until you put your offer out there. Here's how this method works. First, you take your irresistible offer. Let's call it how to train your goldfish to do backflips. Then you whip up a landing page with an irresistible sales pitch. And finally, you run ads or post-avote it organically and see if anybody actually buys. If people do buy, congratulations. You've got a winner and you can build the course knowing that there's demand. But what if people don't buy? Well, at least you didn't spend six months making fish trading videos for an audience that just doesn't exist. Just refund any stragglers that did buy the pre-sale and move on. This method is great because it's lean, fast, and keeps you from wasting time on those bad ideas. But it does come with one problem. If you haven't fully committed to the idea, you might give up before you know if it's actually a winner. Which leads us to option number two, building it and making it work. If you decide to go this route, you'll start by creating what's called a minimum viable product. That means it's the least amount of effort and time for someone to make the transformation that you're promising. For us, that meant eight videos that were all about six to ten minutes in length. We shot it with professional cameras because we had them lying around. But for you, this could just be shot on your iPhone or by using your webcam. We'll go more into that later in the course. You can build your course out more later based on demand. But for now, it's enough that people can just get in there, start trying it out and get that transformation. Then you're going to go through the same steps as option one. Building out your landing page and selling it through ads or by posting about it organically on social. But because you actually have a product, you can start giving it to people and creating case studies to feature on your website and in your marketing. So which direction should you go? If you have absolutely no idea what your course should be about and you want to start throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks, then I recommend the presale method. It could end up saving you a lot of time creating something that nobody actually wants. But if you're able to do some market research like pulling your audience, talking to people you know or scouring the internet and the idea keeps looking more and more like a winner, my recommendation is to build it out and make it work. In the very worst case, as long as the offer is within your niche or your area of expertise, then there's a good chance you can sell it to the people who buy your next offer. That's what Avenue S. Like we said in the intro, when we launched our course on video production, it was a tough sell to a cold audience. But now it's done over a million dollars in sales with people who bought our next course on how to create viral content. I also love this build and make it work method because you can always add on to your course as customer feedback starts rolling in. If your students felt like they missed an important step, added in as a bonus after the fact. That's exactly what we did in our main course. We started with an editing masterclass lesson, but found people specifically wanted to learn more about our cool editing transitions. So we actually ended up adding in 10 mini editing bonus lessons later, teaching them exactly how to do that. The people who had already purchased were stoked on the course upgrade, and we were able to create a flashy new bonus for new students rolling in. Just remember that no matter which way you go, the important thing is to get started and learn as much as you can as quickly as possible. You're going to make mistakes. You're probably going to make decisions that look dumb in hindsight, but the quicker that you can get those out of the way, the quicker you're going to have a successful product. In the next lesson, we're going to talk about how to test the pricing for your offer and find that sweet spot. See you over there.
