 I am a algorithm nerd, and today I will be nerding the heck out. While there is a ton of complicated computing going on behind the scenes every single time you swipe up, I'm going to boil it down to the absolute simplest terms. Alright, the most important metric you need to focus on is watch time. Since a huge percentage of people on the platform are passive viewers, meaning that they don't comment, share, save, or even like content, the only way to truly know whether they like something is if they keep watching. You can see it for yourself. For example, if you went on the platform and started watching football videos all the way to the end, suddenly your feed is going to be stuffed with football content. This is something that we've tested on all of the accounts that we manage. Typically, a good ratio for likes on a piece of content is if 10% of the people watching it are also liking. But we have had videos with as high as 30% liking, and they ended up flopping. And we've also had videos with very little engagement do extremely well. Just proving that watch time is the main thing pushing the algorithm. So the reason that they base the platform off watch time is they want people to stay on the platform for as long as humanly possible. Right now, all of the social media platforms are fighting for attention, and it's important to reward the content that keeps people captivated the longest. So if someone watches 100% of your video, TikTok is going to show it to an audience similar to that one person, because they are the most likely people to watch it all the way through, and on and on and on into infinity, hopefully into millions, maybe billions of views. With all of that said, this course is basically a masterclass on how to get the highest watch time humanly possible. Every extra second that somebody spends on your content increases that video's reach. So you're going to be learning how to milk your audience of every moment of attention you possibly can. Later in this course, we're going to be getting into the value of shares and comments, but through the lens of using them to increase your watch time. For example, if someone scrolling through comments, your video is still going to be playing in the background. So if you create an engaging, polarizing, or funny conversation in the comments, viewers could scroll for minutes, adding exponentially to your overall watch time. More on that in later lessons. So what happens behind the scenes when you post a TikTok? First off, it's always going to start by showing that content to a small pool of people. If you have no followers, it might be 50 to 500 people. If you have, let's say, 50,000 followers, it could be up to 5,000 people. This pool is typically mostly followers with a small amount of new people mixed in. If your channel isn't getting any views at all, you've probably done something to upset the algorithm, and you're more than likely going to have to start a new account with a fresh email address. Later in this course, we'll go over how to know whether you should start a new account, but if you're in that boat, don't worry at all. Everything is fine. I cannot stress how important it is for that first pool of people to love the content that you post. Since, as you now know, if the watch time is low, it will live forever in flop land. That is why it's so important to start with one specific niche. Let's say you post a few videos about golf, and you get 10,000 followers. Then you post a video about cooking. Chances are high that that first pool of people to see the piece of content are the people who followed you for golf. If those people don't also love cooking, your watch time is cooked, and the post is going to go nowhere. The question becomes, will the same people that followed me for all of my content up until now, like my next post? It's that simple. If the answer is yes, post it. If the answer is no, either don't create it in the first place, or consider starting a new channel if you feel it's something that you need to pursue. That said, there are some ways to work different topics or hobbies into your niche. What can you do if you have zero followers? That's where hashtags come in. Using hashtags is like adding a category to the video that you're posting. So let's say you post a funny video about golfing, and you use the popular hashtags viral FYP and for you. That first test pool of 500 people that see the video will be absolutely anybody on the app, regardless of their interests, including people who have never golfed or only like science facts, trending dances, or stock market tips. If that video lands in someone's feed who has no interest in the content that you're creating, it's going to be an instant scroll decimating your watch time and telling TikTok that your content is not worth watching. Not ideal. So let's say you use a few hashtags relevant to golf. TikTok will see that and show it to people who have engaged with other posts using that hashtag before. And that's when the magic happens. It's going to start showing it to people who are similar to the audience who liked that content and on and on. If you think that your content is going to be a hit for absolutely everybody on the platform, go ahead and use generic hashtags, but I almost guarantee it's going to resonate more with a specific niche. So we typically find three to five hashtags that we feel narrow in on a niche as much as possible. You can find out how popular hashtag is by the number of views, and we typically try to use hashtags with more than 10 million views. If you're not sure where to start, try researching similar creators or videos to see what hashtags they're using. One more important note when it comes to hashtags is to quickly check out the top videos from a hashtag before you use it. Sometimes a hashtag can have a completely different meaning than you think, and using it could send your video to a completely different audience than you intended. Another way TikTok categorizes videos is using audio. If someone watches a video with a specific song or sound all the way through, TikTok is more likely to show videos using that sound to those people again. By properly labeling your videos with the song you use, it's going to hit the four-view page of people who have a history liking post with that song, but here is an extremely important note. A lot of the time a song or sound is associated with a trend, and if your video doesn't follow that trend, it's going to reach the wrong people. For example, if a song is viral for a dance, and you use it in the background of your cooking TikTok, you're probably going to be destroying your chances at virality because it's going to be hitting the four-view page of people who like that trending dance, and not cooking. I cannot stress this enough before you use a viral sound, make sure you know how people are using it on the platform, and whether your content belongs to those videos. Just like we talked about with hashtags. Alright, you hit post, now it happens. First, TikTok is going to share your post with that small test audience that we talked about. If your watch time is good enough, you'll hit the second level, which we find is usually between 5 and 10,000 people. Your video will likely stop growing for a moment while the algorithm decides whether it's good enough to keep pushing. Depending on how good your watch time is with that group of people, it will either stop there or be sent out to the next phase, which is typically between 25,000 and 100,000. Finally, if TikTok decides that you actually have a viral piece of content that can be enjoyed by a mass audience, it's going to push it out to the millions. An example of this is Meg's first post on her account. She had zero followers and got 12 million views and 20,000 followers from one post of her dancing with her daughter. It's also normal for a video with over 100,000 views to pick up after a week or two and keep growing. This is a rule of thumb, but the biggest takeaway is that if you're stuck in the 50 to 500 view range at the start, all you need to do is get your watch time up to start moving through the brackets. Now let's talk about the algorithm from a research perspective. Once you find the niche for your channel, I highly recommend training the algorithm for your feed to show you that specific niche. To do this, start by going through the hashtags for your niche and watch every video that's in the top 10 or 20. From there, scroll your main feed and watch relevant videos all the way through and skip past anything irrelevant. We do this so that we can keep a finger on the pulse of what's performing in our specific niche. You'll learn a lot about what's performing well and what isn't hitting to save you time on your own content. It's also going to help a ton for sparking ideas for future content. Another easy way to tell TikTok you're not interested in something is to hold down on a piece of content and it'll give you the option to say not interested. Let's summarize. Start your channel with a specific niche so that everyone who follows loves the content that you're putting out. Use hashtags relevant to that niche to make sure that the video lands in the right feeds. And after all this, if you're not seeing the growth that you want to, it's time to start getting that watch time up. Which is what we'll be learning throughout this entire course. Obviously, there is so much more that goes into the complicated software that learns your hopes and desires to bring you more of the things that you love in real time. But this covers the details that we feel are important for being effective on the platform.
