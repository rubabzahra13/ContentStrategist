 In this lesson, I'm going to show you everything you need to know to dive into content editing. When it comes to editing, efficiency is key because if part of your process takes even a few seconds longer than it should, that time will add up over the course of a day, a week, a year, or a career. Could you do all of your editing from your phone? Absolutely. But there are a lot of advantages to a larger screen and 10 fingers instead of two thumbs. I'm going to start by telling you about all the programs that we use, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and my opinion so that you can make a decision based on your needs. First up is the Adobe Suite, most importantly, Premiere Pro and After Effects. This is the program we use for all of our editing for the first five years of our business. I'm going to start with the pros. Premiere is extremely user-friendly and easy to get started. The bundle also includes After Effects for things like tracking, removing objects, advanced animation, and honestly so many other incredible tools. The cons are after the seven day free trial, Premiere costs $28 for the month, or the Creative Suite is 72 a month. Premiere is also prone to crashes and bugs. In my opinion, Premiere is an absolute powerhouse, and it's still the program that I can work the fastest in. While it does have some flaws, like releasing new versions before they've worked out the kinks, if you're all right with the monthly costs, this program is well worth it. If you're looking for a free option, let's dive into DaVinci Resolve. This is a program we started using in the last year. We picked it up because it's so powerful for coloring, but fell in love with the program overall. Here are the pros. The program is free. There's a paid version for a one-time fee, but you're only missing a couple of features in the unpaid program. The color tools in this program are incredible. It's been the go-to for years for coloring blockbuster movies, and it's gaining popularity just recently as an all-around video editor. Also, rather than having separate programs, you can do VFX right in DaVinci. After a few months of editing, I haven't had any crashes or wasted time on glitches. The biggest con for this program is that it's a little more challenging to understand as a beginner. Currently, we're using DaVinci about 50% of the time. There are a few tools that we still like better in Premiere, and it's the platform that we're more comfortable in, but DaVinci is really becoming a big part of our workflow. I'll let you decide for yourself which one you want to learn on. There's no wrong answer when it comes to these two programs. For this course, we're going to be using Premiere Pro for the examples, but all of the same principles apply. We've included links to learn more about both programs in the description below. Okay, music is a tricky subject for creators, so I'm going to give you everything you need to know. If you're making money from a video, you can't just use any song. Chances are you could get away with it for a while or even a long time, but when your content blows up, which it will, and you use Shake It Off, you'll be getting a call from Taylor Swift's record label. If it's organic content without a paying client, go crazy and use any trending audio on TikTok or Instagram. Before getting into video production, I worked at record labels, and it was common to see music getting five or six figures for a small ad placement. Because of that, if an artist or label sees a song being used without pay, they expect to see compensation. So to get around that, there are royalty-free music websites and music that are free to use on TikTok for paid content. The music platforms we use are SoundStrike. You can use this music for absolutely anything, so even if McDonald's loved your TikTok so much they wanted you to make a broadcast commercial out of it, you can use the music from SoundStrike. We also use MusicBed. The overall quality here is better. You probably have some songs for MusicBed on your Spotify playlist, but the usage is a little bit more limited. You pay more depending on the size of the company you're working with. And if you want to run it on anything but social media, there's a higher licensing fee. There's also a library of music that's free for paid content on TikTok, and I'll put a link to get to it in the description. Sound Effects and Graphic Elements. This won't be applicable to everyone, but something we use a lot to add flavor in our videos is Sound Effects and occasionally graphic elements. For Sound Effects, the quickest program is Soundly. Soundly is a drag and drop sound effect library that makes this process so fast, but not all of the audio is extremely high quality. We'll go over this more in the next video, but this adds a lot to your video because people see with their ears, and if someone jumps into the water, but you don't have audio because there was someone talking next to the camera, you can always just source it afterwards. In VatoElements is a site that we have a subscription to, with higher quality sound effects, and it also gives you access to video templates, graphics, and stock footage. This might not be necessary for what you're doing, but if you're creating something and you want a great intro, title, or need a video shot that you don't have access to, it's definitely worth checking out. Now that you have an overview on the programs we use, I'm going to pass it over to Khan who's going to walk you through our editing workflow on Premiere Pro.
