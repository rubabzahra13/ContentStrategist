 In this lesson, we're taking a deep dive into the essentials of making ads that one, capture attention and two, drive action. After many years of trial and error working as a corporate creative director, I've narrowed down the seven key elements that an ad needs to make it scalable and memorable, all while driving more traffic than ever to your page. It doesn't matter if you're selling a physical product, a digital product, or a service. All of these elements will apply to you. These key insights have had the most impact in my direct conversations with brands, so I'm fired up to share them with you today. Consider this lesson of rinse and repeat strategy that takes the guesswork out of your ad making. Get ready to dive in and learn how to leverage each element to create videos that captivate, resonate, and drive action. Let's do it! As you can come in so many formats and styles, but every great ad follows a handful of core elements. Think of these seven elements as your North Star, like a checklist you'll reference when creating your scripts. You don't need to use every single one in every ad you make, but some are non-negotiable, because every ad needs a strong hook, problem, solution, and call to action. But the way you approach each can shift depending on your audience, platform, and campaign goals. Now let's explore how to fine tune and prioritize these elements to make the biggest impact. The first and probably most important of the elements, your hook. You only have three seconds to convince a total stranger on the internet that your video is worth watching. How is your ad going to stop potential customers from scrolling by in the first place? I recommend having at least five variations of this with each ad you're creating. If you can't stop the scroll, the rest of the ad body will not matter. Your hook is so important, it has its own lesson in module 3, so don't worry, we're going to share a lot more on that soon. Just know the hook is a must. Element number two, the problem. Houston, we have a problem. Or at least we should. Why does the customer need your product? What does it solve? Sometimes it's obvious like shampoo for curly hair. Maybe curly hair and individual struggle is dry hair. And your shampoo makes their hair nourished and soft. Someone with dry curly hair will instantly understand why a nourishing product would benefit them. But sometimes you'll have to educate or tell a story to get them on board. Let's just say we're trying to sell silk pillowcases. That same curly hair curly might have no idea that her pillowcase is one of the main reasons why her hair is frizzy and dry every morning. You have to educate her a bit explaining how regular pillowcases cause friction and breakage as she's tossing and turning. That cotton pillowcase is absorbing moisture out of her hair for eight hours each night. So now what? Let's do a quick exercise. Take a moment to pause this video and jump to your workbook to write down every problem your customer avatar might have that your product or service will solve. Set a timer for five minutes and try to write down as many as possible. Go ahead, I'll be here. Element number three, the solution. Not just a solution, but the best damn solution on the market without a shadow of a doubt. With a silk pillowcase, our curly hair friend can wake up with smooth, healthy hair each morning. The goal is to ensure the solution is clear. Why is your product the most obvious answer? Even when considering competitors. Ultimately, your solution is all about showing how and why your product solves the problem for the customer in a way that feels as painless and convenient as possible. We'll dive deeper into this with Connor in the script writing lesson. Now check back to your workbook and take a look at this list of problems we just created. It's time to write a solution that directly solves each one. For example, problem. Curly hair could be frizzy and dry. Solution. Our shampoo has humidity resistant moisture locking ingredients. Element number four, value props. Why sure the customer care and what are your product benefits? This is where you need to figure out your product's value propositions or VPs for short. We'll use this term throughout the course to remember. VP, value prop. A VP is a clear statement that explains the specific benefits your product offers, how it solves your customer's problems, and why it's better than the competition. It's what makes your product unique and convinces potential customers to choose you over others. So what are three to four statements that set your product above others? That's why all bird states they make the world's most comfortable shoes. But they're also made from nature, water repellent, and have minimalist designs. Or how one AG1 drink replaces the six vitamins you take every morning. Every product has VP's that make your product more exciting to the customer. Especially over your direct competitors. Lean into your VP's. Element number five, social proof. Why is your product credible? Has anyone written an article about you? Do you have five star reviews? Have you won awards? Do you have a ton of customers send you videos of their experience? Maybe they're before and after photos? These are all things that build trust with the customer and show them that your product is credible. If you don't have these, make it a priority within your business. You need that social proof to create enough trust for someone to purchase. Think about creating a community around your product. Maybe you make probiotics or gut vitamins and have sold real digestive issues for people. You probably have some customers or super consumers as I like to call them that advocate loudly for your product telling all of their friends and family that they need to try it too. Try to get a passionate testimonial from these people. Every friend group has a super consumer. You can't miss them. Conor goes way more in depth on the power of social proof and how you can create it for your business in module three. So stay tuned. Element number six. You're closing inspirational outro or reminder of benefits. Okay, you're on the final stretch. Maybe the customer needs a reminder of everything you just mentioned in one punchy sentence. Use this as your chance to talk directly to them. Human to human. If they made it this far, they're probably interested to buy or learn more. A great tactic here is describing what their life can look like in a day, month, or year if they were to try your product today. It took one night with my silk pillowcase to wake up to softer, smoother hair. No more styling tools or globs of product. Can you believe these are my day four curls? Try it right now in your workbook using your own product or service. Here's an example to help you format this outro. It only took a amount of time with your product to transformation. No more pain point, pain point, or alternative option. Element number seven. Call to action. The final element is almost as important as your hook. Without it, all of your hard work capturing your customer's attention and convincing them your product is amazing will be for nothing. This is your call to action. It tells your customer exactly what they need to do next. Try to get more creative than go to URL today. Maybe there's an offer in your hook you want to reiterate here. Or if your product needs more education, you suggest they learn more. Calls to action or CTAs are often overlooked. But you'd be surprised how effective they can be. Tell them where they need to go or they might just keep scrolling. The beauty of writing your scripts this way is these elements are all interchangeable. Meaning besides the hook and call to action, you can reorder them to see what resonates with your audience. If you see a sudden drop off in attention, rearranging the elements can be an easy fix. More on this in module four, creative iterations from analytics. Congratulations! You've mastered the seven core elements of creating a great hero ad.
