 Have you ever zoned out and 30 minutes later found yourself reading an article titled something like Seven Signs You Group in the 90s or 9 things only people with siblings will understand? The hot is the power of a listicle and in this lesson I'm going to teach you how to use it to sell your product. Listicles are powerful for a few reasons. First they're great at catching people's attention and creating curiosity. When someone hears something like 5 surprising benefits of using made up make up daily, they're curious to find out more. The second reason is because it feels like they're coming from a reliable third party. Even if it's on the brand's website, people are used to seeing these lists by media outlets like Buzzfeed or HuffPost so it feels like an objective opinion of the product. So how do you write an effective listicle? First and most importantly is a buzzy, hooky headline. It needs to be something that creates real curiosity in your audience. If you just do seven reasons why made up make up is the best product ever. It's obviously an ad and you haven't created any curiosity to keep reading. You want the title to create FOMO or fear of missing out. Something like 7 reasons everyone is switching their foundation to this make up brand creates a ton of curiosity. It feels like there's a secret that you're missing out on and you want to be a part of it. I've created a list of headline examples that you can use for inspiration in the lesson description below. Once you land on an irresistible title, it's time to write the list. For each item on the list, you're going to include a title, a brief explanation in a paragraph and an image. To keep people engaged, you need to make good on the promise that you made in your title. For example, if you say five surprising benefits of using made up make up daily and number one isn't that surprising, you've just lost the viewer's trust and they're probably going to continue on their daily scroll. You need to keep this list extremely interesting. So how do you use the list to convince people that your product is the perfect fit for them? You're going to focus on using the list to do two things. Knock down objections and show your product features. For example, if the main reason people won't buy your product is price, you need to use the list to convince them it's worth the cost. If the main objection is trust, you need to use the list to show how many people are having results with the product. To get a better idea of how this works, let's look at a brand that has used listicles as part of their strategy to become a billion dollar company. I'm going to be using an example from Hexlad. I have no affiliation with the brand, but I thought they did a really great job here. Hexlad's listicle title is five reasons a million plus home shafts are making the switch to Hexlad. I don't know about you, but I'm curious. Number one on the list is cook an entire meal in one pan. Then the paragraph underneath explains how you can use it to cook on the stove, then put the whole pan into the oven. You might never actually use this feature, but they're making the pan sound like it's worth the cost because it saves you time. Number two is effortless cleanup. Next to the title is a video of a pan going into the dishwasher, and the paragraph talks about how easy the nonstick coating makes it to wipe the pan off. Number three is perfect heat distribution. This one speaks for itself. Number four is that it's trusted by Michelin star chefs worldwide with a photo of chef Gordon Ramsay. They know that trust is the main objection for this pan. And if chef Gordon Ramsay trusts it, so can you. And finally, number five is that it's backed with a lifetime warranty. This is a great way to get people who are on the fence over the edge. So why did Hexclad do such a great job with this? These are all things that would have lived on any product landing page, but they were able to work it into a list that people were actually curious enough to read. It knocked down all the main objections and made good on the title and shared why home chefs are switching to their pans. So what do you do after the list? This is where there is a huge difference between all the listicles online and where you're going to need to test what's best for you. The first option is to have a CTA below the list to shop the product. This will take people to the product landing page that we've gone over in this course. While the CTA can be as simple as a button, if you go this route, I'd recommend making it a section that has a few key details like your guarantee, free shipping over $X dollars, maybe a few product details, and a discount code if you have one. The other way you can go is sell people on the product below your list. So for example, after the list, you could include a product feature section, a social proof section, and a limited time offer. Then if you've done all the selling on that page, you could take people directly to the checkout or to your product landing page if you think people need more convincing. The reason there's no one size fits all solution when it comes to the listicle customer journey is it completely depends on the product you're selling and the amount of convincing it takes to get people to purchase. That's why just like everything in this course, I encourage you to test absolutely everything to find the combination that works best for you. In the download section, I've included two versions of the listicle landing page. One that's short and leads to the product landing page and one that's a little longer, which you can experiment between using to guide people to the checkout or sending them to a product landing page. Feel free to choose your own adventure. Next, we're going to take a deep dive into an editorial style landing page. Take it away, Con!
