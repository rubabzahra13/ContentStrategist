 In this lesson, I'm going to teach you how to set up your first ads and your first campaign from scratch. And if you need help getting to this stage in terms of setting up the business manager or setting up the ad account itself, there's going to be links in the description for you. The first thing you want to do is go to your business manager under add accounts and click add on the top right corner. Here you'll be creating a new ad account from scratch. You can name it anything you want. When selecting your time zone, you're going to want to set it for three hours ahead. So for me, I'm in Pacific Standard Time and I'm going to set it to Eastern. And then you're going to need to set your currency for us, we're in Canadian dollars. And then on the next section, you'll choose it's for my business, not for another business or client. Agreed to the terms and conditions. And then you'll want to add your payment info. If you already have a credit card on file, you can just use that or you can add a new one. Next, you can select open in ads manager right here to actually open up the ad account. The first thing you want to do when setting up your campaign is click create. There are a number of different objectives that you can set your campaign to being awareness, a traffic campaign engagement. For the purpose of this demonstration, I'm going to choose sales since that's what we're going for. Typically, you wouldn't need to use an awareness or traffic or engagement campaign as those aren't great at driving conversions. And typically that's what you're trying to do. From here, you're typically going to set up a manual sales campaign. You would select advantage shopping campaign if you have a Facebook shop setup. Now you're going to see this screen where you have your campaign level, your ad set level and your ad level. At the campaign level, you're going to see a ton of options, assuming that your campaign doesn't need to fall under any special ads category, which is employment, housing, social issues, things like politics. You don't need to touch anything. All you're going to do from here is name your campaign and then click next. Now you can go ahead and name your ad set. And on the ad set level, this might be a differentiator for the creative that you made. So in this case, maybe we made a new video asset. It will be like video November 25, 2024, put the date there. The next step is to choose your conversion objective. Here we want to drive sales to our website. And that's what you're going to choose 99% of the time. For the performance goal, you want to maximize number of conversions. You'll see a lot of different options here. You can just ignore those after choosing your conversion location. You need to choose your pixel. If you don't have one here, this is where you're going to go ahead and make a pixel. And in the next lesson, Glenn's going to go over everything tracking related. Here, you can name your pixel anything you want. And then you'll just put in your website. And from here, it gives you the option to take the code and put it onto your website. The next thing you want to choose is your conversion event. 99% of the time, you'll just choose purchase. Under cost per result goal, you don't need to worry about that. Here, you'll see a little toggle, show more options. Under there is where you'll set your attribution settings. And this is the amount of data you want Facebook to take into account when optimizing for a sale. The only thing you need to do here is go to view through and turn that off. That refers to people who have seen one of your ads on Facebook, but didn't click it, and then went on to purchase. Sometimes this can muddy the data a little bit. So we're just going to turn it off for now. You don't have to worry about dynamic creative. And then the next section, you'll just go ahead and set your daily budget. Earlier in the course, we spoke about how to set a budget. And if you're not sure what to do here, just refer back to that. For now, I'm going to set it to $50 a day. When setting the schedule, I always set the start date as tomorrow at midnight. The reason I do this is so that we don't get any weird burst spend throughout the day. If you're close to the end of a day and you start it right now, you might end up spending the full budget within a few hour period at a higher cost per purchase than you're actually looking for. You can ignore anything to do with budget scheduling, unless you were doing lead gen and you could only drive leads during a specific period of the day because you have somebody on the other end in a call center. This isn't something you need to worry about. The next section is where you're going to set your audience. So this is who we want to target and where since we're setting this up for one peak, and they are a digital brand selling globally, we can choose worldwide. So I just go over here and choose all of the countries. And for the minimum age, we'll choose 21 plus and for the gender, we'll choose all. You can go very broad with Facebook as their algorithm is very good at finding potential purchasers. A lot of people think that they need to target very specific audiences, such as somebody who's interested in social media and somebody who wants to be a creator, but Facebook will find that person on their own. Since we're targeting worldwide, we're going to want to set up the beneficiary here. It's just a legal thing for meta. So we chose one peak creative. The next thing we can choose is where exactly we want our ads to show. Typically, what we'll do is we'll choose advantage plus placements. That is the meta recommended one. And it just means let Facebook decide if we are using a creative or for some reason, we can't target Instagram or Facebook. We'll choose manual placements then and we would unselect the ones we're not able to target. The same goes for devices. If for some reason we can only target iPhones over Android, that's where we would do it. But for now, we can just ignore all of this and choose the recommended option of the advantage plus placements. The next and last thing we want to do is set up our ad itself. And again, we'll just choose any name. We don't have to worry about a partnership ad here. This is where you're going to choose your business Facebook page. Since we made this ad account for this lesson, it's not going to show up for us, but it will show up for you. After ad setup, you'll choose create ad, manually upload, single image. You can unclick multi-advertiser ads as those typically don't perform as well. Now you're going to choose your ad creative. We're going to choose video ad and you can actually ignore these first two sections, creative setup and text and just go straight to media. From here, you upload from your computer, the video ad that you made. While that's loading, you can hit next. Facebook will then ask you if you want to trim the video, crop it or add any enhancements. I typically hit cancel because we've done all that beforehand. By hitting cancel, it doesn't actually stop the video from uploading. It just stops any of those predetermined adjustments to the video that Meta wants to do. Now that you've got your video setup, you want to add your primary text and your headline and your description. This is where we're going to put the caption that we worked on in the video ad Academy. You'll get a lot of AI generated options from Facebook here. You're welcome to look through those and if something seems better than what you already made, you can use that. You'll then upload your headline. It looks like Facebook auto generated a few headlines, but we have one that we already made. The description only shows up under a few different placements, so we usually just leave it blank. The next thing you'll do is set your call to action and this is whether you want a learn more button, get off or book now, that kind of thing. Typically we leave it at learn more. You can ignore all of these info labels and promo codes. And the last thing you want to do is put in your URL. This is where somebody's going to go after they click on your ad. Then hit publish and your first ad is live. And there you have it. That's how you set up your first ad. It's so simple, especially with the Facebook algorithm being so powerful. In the next lesson, we're going to be talking about tracking your ads and sales.
