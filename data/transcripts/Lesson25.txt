 This is it the final step in the pre-production stage once we complete your shot list It's time to shoot so let's get after it Okay, I know what you're thinking we just built out a storyboard dude Why would we need to do a shot list as well? There's an important distinction between a storyboard and a shot list and in this lesson We'll be learning what that difference is and how a shot list can be your secret weapon to maximizing Efficiency on your shoot days. Here's what we'll answer in this lesson What is a shot list when should I use a shot list? How do I make a shot list? Let's dive in number one What is a shot list if a storyboard is used to portray your overall vision and general flow of the video a Shot list is your step-by-step guide to ensure you get everything you need on production day There's absolutely nothing worse than beginning and exciting at it after a long shoot only to realize One pivotal shot is missing I've been there before and it either means scheduling a time and resource-consuming reshoot or Sacrificing your original idea and making a compromise Neither of these are great options, but they're both 100% avoidable and that's why we make shot lists a Shot list should be an interactive checklist You can use to tick off every single shot in your video as their captured one Important thing to note here is that your shot list will be completely internal and nobody other than yourself Or the people helping you create this piece of content needs to see it for that reason you should use whatever format makes sense to you number two When should I use a shot list? Shot list should really be utilized for every piece of content you create this may seem unnecessary if you're making a Tick-Tock that only consists of three different shots But if you get in the habit of making these for yourself now It will ensure you stay organized on the days when you shoot 30 different videos all at once over the course of three hours Which we've done and it would have been an absolute Nightmare without our shot list number three. How do I make a shot list? The answer of this question will vary from creator to creator But for simplicity and ease of access I'm just gonna build hours as a checklist in the notes app. Let's start by reviewing the fundamentals There are two main categories We make sure to note when creating a shot list framing and camera movement Glenn touched on these in detail earlier So if you haven't watched his module on video fundamentals I would highly recommend doing that first We've also created a video fundamentals cheat sheet which you can find in that section here are a few quick Reminders of different framing ultra wide wide medium tight extreme tight now for the camera movement Here are a few more examples to jog your memory static handheld push in hand left Pan right pull out and tracking now. Let's put the two together medium pan left wide push in and extreme tight pull out Okay, you get the idea for every single shot in your video You'll note the framing the movement and the action being taken by the subject you're shooting So when you put it all together, it will look something like this wide push in on Gary walking in the park Tight pan right on turtle sitting in grass medium pan right on Gary picking up turtle and so on until we have every Single shot from the entire video on this list and this example I'm writing out the shots sequentially as they take place in the video However, there will be instances where your shooting scenes out of order Which is why the list is so important to make sure nothing gets missed now It's your turn open up your notebook and make a shot by shot checklist for your video then the final step is just Taking the boxes as you get the shots It's a very basic checklist But it will always prove to be a powerful tool to keep you organized as you go into your shoot Which is exactly what you're about to do Congratulations on completing the pre-production section This can feel like the most tedious and labor intensive part of content creation So if you've made it this far you're going to have a blast with the next several videos.
