 Once upon a time, in our earliest days walking this planet, there was a tribe of brave men and women who spent days on empty stomachs, facing the most extreme elements and ferocious beasts, as they forged the forests and hunted the hills and valleys for food. In this tribe was a thin young girl with ice-blue eyes and an attitude three times her size. They called her Mela. Mela knew she was destined to be a great hunter, like her father who was the tribe's leader. But it was forbidden for a woman, an especially young girl, to join the men on their hunts, and this tribe women were worshipped as the givers of life, and were to be protected at all costs. But Mela didn't like to be protected, so one night as the sun slept from its place in the sky and was replaced by a blanket of darkness, all of the women lay down to sleep. With hunger in their bellies and hope in their hearts, for the men who were out somewhere in the endless night. All of the women that is, except for Mela. As the sound of deep breathing replaced the subtle crackling of the fire along the walls of their cavern, Mela slept out of her mother's loving arms and tipped her to cross the shadows where she crept out into the brisk open air, and disappeared into the darkness. As the glorious sun once again graced the sky and kissed the jungle with its soft morning light, the men returned from their hunt with the biggest beast the tribe had ever seen. But there would be no celebration that day, because although the hunters had returned, Mela had not. Three days and three nights passed, as her father scoured the depths of the jungle and her mother searched the depths of her soul. How could she let her sweet baby girl leave the safety of their sanctuary? How could she have failed at her most important duty? And while Mela's parents worried and wept, Mela pushed onward down the path toward home. Her track to find food had become a fight for survival, but what kept her alive with the lessons she learned from the stories shared around fires. Eched into her mind as they were on the walls of the cave she called home. She collected fresh water that had fallen on leaves and grabbed grubs that she found underfoot. She built shelter and trees up high off the ground and she painted her face with soot. As she waited and watched for her prey to approach, the images flashed in her mind. A beast snarled below as she drew up her bow and attacked from above and behind. As Mela returned to her tribe with the beast on her back, she was welcomed by the tear-eyed, cheerful faces of her mother and father, and her courage was celebrated by the rest of the tribe. They danced around the fire deep into the night, and as Mela shared her story, it was carved into the wall of the cave to be discovered centuries later, holding even more power than when it was originally written. For thousands of years, humans have used stories to communicate important lessons. Stories entertain us and embolden us. Stories have been used to guide civilizations to unimaginable success and tear down barriers both figuratively and physically. To be human is to tell stories, and that is what we're here to learn about. Although storytelling has transformed from writing on rock walls to shooting and sharing videos online, the fundamentals have never changed. In this lesson, we're going to break down story to its basic and foundational structure and then use that outline to guide us as we write tales of our own. By the end of this video, you'll understand what a story arc is, how to create a character, why tension is an important tool, what a star moment is, and how to create one. These steps can be used whether you're creating a feature film or a simple TikTok. The fundamentals are the same. Now let's take that beautiful idea you have from your brainstorm and turn it into a story. Step number one, understanding a story arc. Every story you've ever heard, read, watched or witnessed has followed a story arc. Some probably more successfully than others, but they all do. You may remember learning about story arc in English class, but it's an important lesson to revisit. So let's break it down. The plot of any story should always start with a setup that introduces you to the main character and then lead into an initial conflict. From there, your audience should be invested as you guide them through rising action that leads to the most impactful and exciting moment of the story, the climax. Or as we'll be calling it the star moment. This stands for something they'll always remember. Once your audience has received that payoff, you should tie up any loose ends and summarize your story lesson. Step number two, creating a character. Now that you have a story arc to follow, it's time to create a main character. This doesn't always have to be a person, but they should always have a personality. Think of Pixar's Toy Story, for example. Or an even better example, in my opinion, is Marcel the Shell. If you've never heard of Marcel, I would highly recommend doing a quick search. It started as a YouTube video about a shell in his family and has since been turned into a feature film by A24 Studios. Now that is a great character. When creating a character for your story, it's important to give them traits that people can relate to. Even if the main character is yourself, think about how can people relate to me? What are some characteristics that people may see in themselves? Whether they're good or bad doesn't matter as much as long as they're relatable. I'm sure we can all recall sympathizing with a villain or two. Step number three, building tension. There's a million different ways to build tension, but it pretty much all comes down to one thing, the unknown. Tension is created when the viewer has a desired outcome, and they're unsure whether or not that outcome will be reached. This creates a feeling of uncertainty within us that leaves us constantly curious to find out what's going to happen. Creating tension is our number one tool for retaining an audience. Step number four, the star moment. This is the moment they've all been waiting for. So give them something they'll always remember. When telling a story, you should always be guiding your viewers to this moment. It could be action-packed, or incredibly emotional, or visually inspiring, or absolutely hilarious, but it usually holds some kind of lesson that your viewer will take with them. Hopefully for years to come. Step number five, summarize or call the action. The final step in your story should be a strong summary. Your audience should leave feeling like all of the tension is relieved, and they've received the answers to the questions they had. Unless those answers can be found in the next place you'd like them to go, which can be done with a called action. This is a message at the end of your story encouraging viewers to take action on what they've just learned. This can be a powerful tool in growing an audience. Okay, now that I've walked you through the fundamentals of storytelling, we're going to put these steps into action. It may seem like this process is more suited to a Hollywood production, but we're going to break down one of our recent TikToks to show you the same fundamentals apply to short-form content. This is an honest ad for Patagonia. What links would you go to to protect our planet? Would you spend $50 on a hat made from old fishing nets? Of course. Would you buy an electric vehicle? Yeah, sure. Would you live in it to reduce your carbon footprint? I guess. Would you give away everything you've ever owned to who? The earth. That's what we did. The whole company. Three billion dollars. Okay. Patagonia. For people who care about the planet and have lots of money. Step number one. Understanding a story arc. The story arc of this video follows the conversation between the fictitious director of nature at Patagonia and one of their loyal customers. Our goal was to exaggerate the length Patagonia expects its customers to go to and order to protect the planet. We did this by gradually introducing more extreme measures until we reach our climax. The customer giving up all of his belongings and living half naked and afraid in the woods. And relief tension. Step number two. Creating a character. For this TikTok, we created two characters. The director of nature at Patagonia and the loyal customer. We wanted to play on relatability, so we used Yvonne Sheenard, Patagonia's actual CEO, as inspiration. We already know what his motives are, so it's easy to apply those same characteristics to our character. And then, of course, exaggerate them a bit. Or a lot. We next created the loyal customer, who would do anything to support the brand. This character was easy because he just had to be agreeable and follow the plot. Step number three. Building tension. In this case, we used increasingly dramatic situations and tone to build tension and then supported that with orchestral music and suspenseful sound design. The viewer feels anticipation and wants to see what lengths this customer will go to. Step number four. The star moment. Our star moment was the director of nature's monologue about giving the entire company away to the planet. Followed by the loyal customer, naked in the woods. This summarizes our point and wraps up the video leading into our summary. Step number five. Summarize. In this case, the summary was a joke. We got the point across and used the final tagline as one last jab at Patagonia to leave viewers with an understanding of the point we were trying to make. There you have it. The fundamentals of storytelling. Now, as an exercise, I want you to take that great idea you brainstormed and work through these five steps. When you're finished with that, you'll be ready to write a script, which is exactly what we'll be learning in our next lesson. Step number five.
