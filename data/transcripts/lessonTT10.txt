 By this point in the course, hopefully you have at least one video idea you feel is going to be a slam dunk. You've got a killer hook, it's relatable, shareable, repeatable, and it's engaging all the way through. Sounds pretty awesome. So let's talk about the actual posting and the execution of this video. The fun part. The first step is deciding whether your current channel is still the best to post to, or if you should be starting a new channel altogether. Now before you start panicking, let me explain this. If you already have a TikTok account, you're going to want to begin by answering the following question. Would your current audience be interested in the content you are now wanting to create after you've taken this course? If the answer is an automatic hell yeah, then we suggest continuing to post on your account with the new skills that you've learned. But, but but but, if the answer is a no, or you're starting an entirely new endeavor in a new niche, then you are going to want to start a new account right from scratch. Now don't let an accumulation of past followers hold you back. I want you to completely forget about any followers you've gained on an account, because if they're not at all in a focused niche, a following can actually be counterproductive to a high performing video. Really think about where all of your followers came from and whether they would be interested in your content you're about to post. If the answer is no, then it's time to create a fresh new channel, especially if you tried posting similar content before and heard crickets. Another reason to start fresh is if you're getting zero to 100 or 300 views on your videos. While I do still believe a channel can come back from that, it might be more challenging than starting a channel with no history or reputation with the TikTok algorithm. Here's the facts. You can get over 10 million views on the first post from a new account. I've done it myself. There isn't much difference between an account with hundreds of thousands of followers or an account with zero. Another perk to creating a brand new account is you can also try ideas without the pressure of followers or friends or family watching and judging your content. It's a lot easier to talk about your crazy idea at a family dinner when it has over millions of views and thousands of people saying how much they love it. So if you're a little more introverted, this might be the choice for you. Okay, so now that your account situation is sorted, I want to walk through our seven step posting checklist. Now this is a step by step guide that we work through every single time we post on the platform. You've opened your app, loaded in your edited video. So now what? Let's begin with ways you can enhance your video in the in app editor. First, you're going to add in or tag the music you're using in the video. Adding in music is just another way that your video can be discovered by people on the platform and get more eyes on your content. Even if you are just simply talking to cam, we suggest finding an appropriate instrumental audio. So it doesn't outshine your talking points and setting the volume levels low in the background. Next up is adding a text hook or any additional text box. This is going to help strengthen your chances of getting people to watch your videos through to the end. Even if you have a vocal hook, sometimes adding in another text hook can be super helpful. Here's an example of this in action with a video I posted on my channel, which ended up getting over 4.5 million views. My husband's least favorite food in the whole world is tomatoes juice. You may also want to give more context or support your video's story by adding in additional text box throughout the video. This can be used to drive home important points, show a change in location, or even just add in a little comedy throughout. If there are parts of your video that don't feel crystal clear to you, then your audience is most likely going to be lost as well. A really good practice is to watch through your video once you've loaded it into the app, and then add text box as needed to help expand on your story. Next, let's talk about captioning. If your video is primarily used speaking to camera or has a voiceover, then we always suggest adding in captions so the viewer can follow along and actually hear what you're saying. This helps to avoid any confusion and also encourages people that may be watching with their sound off to turn it on. You never want someone to miss out on your hook because their sound is too low. Offering viewers' visual cues will help keep them engaged throughout. Alright, now your video should be at a point where you can move from the in app editor screen over to the posting stage. This is where you're going to add in the video captions, include hashtags, tag any collaborators, and pick your cover photo. Let's begin with your caption. The biggest mistake I see creators make is just throwing in a half-assed caption before posting your video. Do not do this. I want you to think of your caption as another chance to introduce a hook. This is an opportunity to further spark the viewer's curiosity, and it should never give away the wow moment of your video. Here's an example of some caption hooks that I've used that performed really well. That escalated quickly. The stakes have never been higher. Full amount spent at the end, you'll notice that each of these captions leaves some sort of an answered question, encouraging the viewers that they are going to have to watch until the end to see what I am referring to. Think of your caption hook as your Hail Mary to get people hooked into whatever it is you have to say. Moving on to hashtags, now these are going to live at the end of your caption. As we mentioned earlier in this course, you'll want to include four to five hashtags that are relevant to your video. I cannot stress this point enough. Adding generic hashtags like FYP or Funny Video really isn't super helpful as your video is going to get served to people who probably aren't interested in your niche. Instead, think of who your content is for and what theme your video is about. Pick your hashtags around that. As a quick example, let's look at the set of hashtags I used on this jackfruit video I posted. I used things like moms of TikTok, healthy recipes, husband reacts, vegan meals, and cooking TikTok. All of these hashtags were specific to what the video was about and helped find the right people to view it. Hashtags should be a non-negotiable step in your posting process and one to put some thought into for each video. You may keep some of those hashtags the same, but there will be a few you might want to switch out each time based on your video's theme. Next up is tags. This step is really quite simple. Basically, if you are posting your video as part of a collaboration, you are going to want to tag the brand you are working with. Or let's say you created a video that happened to organically include a brand that you want to work with. Consider tagging them as well. I did this with the video I posted featuring my daughter shopping an old navy. The brand ended up seeing the video, loving it, and actually offered to license the content, which meant money in my pocket with no extra work. How sweet is that? If you're curious to learn more about how to make money on the platform, do not worry, we are going to be fully diving into this in our partnership lesson. Last, but definitely not least, is your cover photo. Pick it intriguing frame from your video that leaves viewers curious to watch if they happen to stumble across your channel. It's also an opportunity for you to include another hook. Let's take Connor's golf channel as an example. All of the videos have a thumbnail title, indicating the value that you are going to get out of that video. We always suggest trying to be strategic with your cover photos instead of just letting the app pick it for you. All right, that is our posting checklist. Now, it's time to hit that button and get your video out into the world. One of two things is now going to happen. Your video is either going to do exceptionally well or you might have what we like to call a flop. And it's all up to the quality of your video and how the algorithm works it through the platform. From here out, don't blame the algorithm for a video's performance. Think of the algorithm as an unbiased judge that's going to rate the quality of your video's using views. By having this perspective, you can move past ideas that don't perform and start to dissect the ones that do. If a video doesn't do super well and lands in that 500 view range, ask yourself whether the hook was strong enough, whether there are laws that feel boring, or if it's a relatable enough idea for people to want to engage with and share. If not, it might be time to go back to the drawing board. Sometimes it's possible that your video just didn't hit the right audience, and if that's the case and you really believe in it, try we working your hook, reworking the video a little bit, and see if you can make it happen. Another way to train the algorithm into pushing your content is to only post the videos that you believe in. I cannot stress this enough. A lot of content creators preach quantity over quality, but if you put something half-assed out in the world, the next time someone comes across one of your videos, they're not going to know whether they're going to get a viral hit or one of your half-ass attempts. Still, post anything that you believe has value and a shot at doing well, but don't post only for the sake of posting or trying to be consistent. It's better to miss the day of posting, sometimes even a week, than put out something that doesn't feel up to your regular standards. All right, one last lesson, stay with me, and this one might be the most important of all. When you have an idea that you're confident in, you need to be persistent. Harry Potter was rejected 12 times before getting published. Van Gogh was only able to sell one painting in his lifetime, but he still created over 900. Walt Disney was fired as an animator, I find that hilarious, for having a lack of imagination. And Stephen King was rejected 60 times before getting his first book published, which sold more than a million copies in the first year. If your posts don't go instantly viral, keep refining and keep posting. Every creator has flops and ideas that don't do as well as they expected, but it's the great ones that don't let it slow them down. My favorite quote of all time is success is the ability to go from failure to failure with enthusiasm. And that perfectly sums up how you are going to succeed on social media. Now it's time for a content creation challenge. Once you've decided on the format for your channel, we want you to post at least three videos every week for the next month, a total of 12 videos. You'll be running each one through the checklist and making sure they appeal to the same audience. Use the hashtag find your peak so we can follow along and cheer you on from afar. So now you have all the tools in your tool belt to create viral TikToks, so you might be wondering, how the heck do I now make money and build a career out of this? We're going to dive into just that in the next lesson.
