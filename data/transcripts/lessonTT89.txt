 In the next two lessons, I'm gonna walk you through our email strategy that has helped us on board, nurture, and increase the lifetime value of the 150,000 contacts that we have welcomed into our email list in the last two years. I've had single emails generate over $90,000 in revenue, and because that email is automated, that number continues to grow every single day. No crazy graphic design, no coding, just killer conversational copy. Served to an audience at the perfect time. As a course creator, you don't have the luxury of speaking face to face with customers in a storefront every day. Sure, your ads in your landing page can give customers some idea of who you are, but email is really where you're gonna be able to connect deeply with your new or potential customers. In this digital course world, email marketing is critical. It's how you're gonna build brand loyalty, nurture relationships with your customers, and hopefully drive more sales down the road. As we've mentioned a few times in this course, our approach is to be as simple and frictionless as possible. When it comes to email, you can go crazy with segmenting tags, analytics, AB tests, but in this lesson, I just want to give you everything you need to know to create an email system that works and is reliable. This is a dead simple strategy that you can set up and forget, or continue to build and iterate on over time. But before we dive into my email broadcast and sequence strategy, I want to begin with my seven best email practices for high open rates and conversions. These are the tips I take into every single email I write. Number one, your subject line is a hook. When it comes to email, there are three things you want every customer to do. Open the email, have a positive experience reading that email, and move on to the next step, if there is one. But numbers two and three are completely off the table. If your email doesn't get opened in the first place, and all of your effort writing that email goes immediately down the toilet. I saw this crazy stat the other day that the average person in a professional setting will receive a whopping 121 emails per day between correspondence and promotional newsletters that they have signed up for. That number totally blew my mind. But let's even just say someone gets a quarter of that. That's still 30 emails that they have to go through and choose what they are going to open. So your goal is to make your email subject line intriguing enough to pass the inbox scroll test. A best practice to get into is to treat your email subject line and preview line like a hook. How can you spark curiosity and hint to a payoff that they'll receive if they decide to open it? As soon as I put this strategy into play, our open rates went from about 25% to 57. And the industry average for a good newsletter open rate is like 17 to 25%. So I'm very proud of that stat. I've put a list of 20 of our best performing subject lines in the lesson description to help you get started. Number two is to use conversational copy. How many generic feeling emails have you tossed directly in the trash bin after reading the first few lines? Sometimes we forget that the people receiving our emails are just other human beings. They like to laugh, they love a relatable moment, appreciate a witty gift, and can be moved by vulnerable stories. Treat them like a friend. Write your emails as if you were writing a letter to someone you're close to. The more that you can connect with your customers on a personal level, the easier it's going to be to have them trust you and encourage them to continue down your funnel. Number three, using AI. This leads perfectly into my next tip, which is to use AI very wisely. Yes, chat GBT can whip up an email for you in about seven seconds that you could copy, paste, and fire out to your audience. But your audience is going to see right through that bot copy, which will probably result in your unsubscribe button getting some serious action. Instead, I use chat GBT as a brainstorming tool or a thought starter, not as a copywriter. Asking chat for a list of value email ideas, more on that in a moment, can be super helpful when building out your email content plan. But I suggest taking those ideas and writing the actual emails yourself, or having someone else on your team do it. Yes, using chat can save you time, but having the email come from your actual voice and working in your personal experiences is going to resonate so much deeper with your subscribers. Number four is email frequency and timing. Your goal should be to connect with your email list consistently, but not to overwhelm them. Nobody likes feeling spammed by someone in their inbox. I have personally found the sweet spot for our list to be two to three emails per week. I typically send my first email of the week on a Wednesday, which is when I send my weekly value newsletter. And if we are doing a sales email, I'll send it on the Friday. In my personal opinion, it doesn't really matter when in the waking hours of the day you send in your email. If your subject line hook is strong enough, they will open it eventually. Some companies will send 15 plus emails per week, which I personally find super annoying. But continue to do so because the sales results, versus the unsubscribe rate, makes it worth it. Everybody has a different strategy when it comes to email cadence. I am just sharing what I find works best for us, based on direct feedback from our students. Here's a little pro tip. Write an email asking your list how often they want to hear from you, and the type of emails they want to receive. I do this every six months as it helps inform our strategy. Number five is the power of a PS. A strategic post script at the end of your emails is a great tool to catch the eye of skimmers and provide a final nudge to take action. Whether that's a reminder about a deadline or a last minute bonus, this is also a great spot to connect with your audience. I like to use the PS to ask them a question or ask for suggestions or feedback. Think of the PS as your Hail Mary and a spot to really connect with your biggest fans who read your emails all the way through. Number six, have a clear CTA. If you want the reader to take action, make it as clear as possible how to do so. I like to mix up the use of colored buttons and hyperlinked text in my emails to see what drives the best conversions. Sometimes I'll actually use both in an email to make sure nobody is unsure of what I want them to do next. And last but not least, number seven, always send a test email. Never hit send without testing every single link or button in your email. Couldjabi has a super simple send test email button that has quickly turned into my BFF. Send a broken link once on an important email and you'll never do it again. I also view the test both on my computer and on my phone to make sure the formatting is just right. It's about a 50-50 feet split on mobile versus desktop these days when it comes to where people are viewing their email. These seven best practices really are what we have used to grow our list and revenue to where we are now and will give you such an awesome launch pad for your own journey. In the next lesson, I'm going to share our email sequence and our weekly broadcast strategy that we have created to serve our community on autopilot. I'll see you over there.
