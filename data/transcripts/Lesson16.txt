 Pablo Picasso once said, good artist copy and great artist steal. In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to research your product or brand so that you can let brilliant minds and creators inform the content that you create. We're going to be learning how to research what makes our product or brand unique and how to find inspiration. The first question you're trying to answer when you research a product or brand is, why should people care? Your job as a content creator is to find what is unique, relatable, surprising, or just interesting about the product or brand you're working with and bring that to the masses. So why should people care? I'm going to walk you through the questions you need to be able to answer about the brand that you're creating for before you get started. If it's your company, it's time to do some soul searching. And if you're creating content for a company that you work for, you'll have the advantage of being able to ask the founders or people who have been there since the beginning. If you don't have the ability to ask the brand or brand manager, you're going to need to scrub the internet for the answer that he's questions. You can use blogs, social media, YouTube, or even Wikipedia to find the answers. So here are the questions to get started in the research process. What is the mission of the brand? A mission statement can be the most valuable piece of information to inform content. For example, Tesla's mission statement is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Compare this to Honda's mission statement of supplying the highest quality yet at a reasonable price. These statements should instantly get your wheels turning. No pen intended. On the content, you could create for each brand. If the brand you're creating content for doesn't have a mission statement, it's time to dig into the fabric of the brand to create one that will guide your content. If we're working with a brand that doesn't have a mission statement, we always ask about their long-term goals with the company. This usually leads to larger overarching brand missions. Not only does this help guide the direction of your brainstorm, but also makes the content more valuable for the company, since it works towards a mission. Next, what are the key features? We did a project for WonderBoom Speaker, and when we found out that it was shockproof and waterproof, coming up with the concepts became infinitely easier. We could pretty quickly start coming up with situations where someone would drop a speaker or lose it in the water. Finding out the unique features of a product or brand will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. From there, you just need to be able to figure out what's relatable, funny, or interesting about those features. These also don't need to be physical features. For service-based companies, sometimes the features are a speed of delivery, quality, warranty, the list goes on. Even if you're creating content for a person, think about their key features. For example, the key features of an influencer you're creating for could be great in the garden, dry sense of humor, world-class style, you get the idea. By researching and writing down these features, you can start to build them out into content ideas. Next question is who is the audience or niche? You have to know who you're creating content for, because a channel's current followers will be the first people to see the content being posted. We've tested posting content we've created for clients on our own channel, and even though it gets hundreds of thousands of views on the client's channel, it only gets a few thousand on ours, because it was created with the client's audience in mind and not ours. A lot of the time, this research is done through trial and error to understand what style of content your audience engages with most. For example, our audience is mostly interested in content creation and video production, whereas Meg's personal audience is mostly moms. The next question to answer is how did the company get here? Every brand is made up of thousands of stories, from how the idea for the company was conceived, to how the founders met or the roadblocks that were hit along the way. Tracing the history of a brand will help to provide a ton of insight into content ideas. A lot of the time, these stories make for great content on their own, but no matter what, they will help to inform the tone and style of the content that you're creating. Next question is who is the competition and how are we different? No matter who you are, there is competition in the same or similar fields creating content, and there's always a ton that you can learn from them. We did a campaign for PDLite, an electric light rehydration brand. They had a history of rehydrating sick kids, but we're trying to break into the sports drink market. We researched campaigns from brands that were in a similar category to what they were trying to get into, targeting professional athletes like Gatorade, Powerade, Nike, Reebok, the list goes on. The market was saturated with content about grit, performance, and the grind. The brand was willing to have fun with their content, and we wanted to make them stand out, so we took those themes and put a new unique spin on it. Here's a bit of it so you can see it. You only get one shot at this thing. Not everyone's going to believe in you, but you're here for the believers. One night on the world stage. I don't want to go and we'll see you. Don't know you were there. Because you've always been there. It's so important to be able to put your finger on why you stand out from the other brands in your category, and work it into the content you create. I want to explain the Picasso quote from the beginning of this lesson. The video we created for PDLite was exactly like everything from Gatorade or Reebok with one difference. We use Santa instead of a professional athlete. That one difference is what made it interesting and fresh rather than being a straight ripoff from the other brands we researched. I don't want you to copy the inspiration that you're researching, but I do want you to take ideas and put your own unique spin on them. You'll see this all the time when it comes to trends on social media. Someone creates a viral video that's so good it becomes a trend and thousands of people copy the video as closely as they can. You might see the first couple and sneaker, but it gets old fast. Then someone will take that trend and make it completely their own with a post that blows up. That's what I want you to do, whether it's trends, ads, or just organic content from other brands and creators. One last fun tip is to use the TikTok Creative Center to see what ads are performing best. In the lesson description, we've included a link that you can use as a tool to watch through all of the best performing TikTok ads. Now that we've shown you how we complete research here at One Peak, it's your turn. Take the next half hour so to answer the questions in the lesson description for your brand and write down your observations in point form. That's it for research. Now this is where the fun begins. Head over to the next lesson where I can't wait to tell you everything that I know about brainstorming. One of my favorite things in the world.
