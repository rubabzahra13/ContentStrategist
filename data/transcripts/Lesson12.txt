 Why are goals important? A Harvard Business study found that 3% of the graduates from their MBA who had their goals written down ended up earning 10 times more than the other 97% put together, just 10 years after graduation. That's insane. If a Harvard study isn't enough for you to take this exercise seriously, here's another example. In 1985, when he was a struggling comedian, Jim Carrey wrote himself a check for $10 million and gave himself 10 years to cash it. It sat in his wallet where he would see it every single day. Exactly 10 years later, he was cast in Dumb and Dumber for, you guessed it, $10 million. A goal gives you focus and drive towards the things that matter to you. Our business thrives off of having huge goals to get us jumping out of bed in the morning and smaller goals that act as trail markers to get there. In this lesson, I'll be showing you our formula for goal setting that has allowed us to grow faster than we could have imagined. The first step is the blue sky period. This is a term that BJ Novak used when they started writing each season of the office. Essentially it meant every idea was on the table, no bad ideas, and no limits. This is a time that you forget what you feel is realistic to achieve in your lifetime and start thinking like Elon Musk. If you want to have a new category of vehicle, send rockets to new planets and release a line of flame throwers, nobody's stopping you. That's where I want you to start. Make a list of everything you want in life that makes your heart skip a beat. You could have a million fans that recognize you every time you go outside, or you could be sailing a yacht on the shores of Italy creating content for yourself. No idea is too big or outrageous. If you want to be successful, it's going to take a lot of hard work and dedication so you need to have goals as a North Star so you know why you're working so hard. Take a moment to pause this video and complete this activity in as much detail as you can. For us, a huge goal we had when we started our business was to have an ad that aired on the Super Bowl. There were only three of us and we were using DSLR cameras so it felt completely unrealistic, but we talked about it constantly. Six months after setting that goal, we were given the opportunity to create a Canadian broadcast ad for a dream brand and we poured our hearts into it. It wasn't meant to run during the Super Bowl, but the brand loved it so much they swapped out their ad last minute, making our goal a reality. If we had told someone our goal was to shoot that scale of ad with only three people in a DSLR camera, they would have told us we were crazy. Which is when we realize that if your goal doesn't sound crazy or impossible, you're not dreaming big enough. The next step is to imagine every detail. Alright, I'm going to lead you through an exercise that has changed my life since I started doing it. What we're going to do is imagine the perfect day five years from now if everything goes completely to plan. Cue the relaxing music. I want you to close your eyes and take a deep breath. You've just woken up in your dream home. Take a look around at your bedroom. What does the view outside your window look like? Now put your feet on the ground and walk to the kitchen. Take in the smells. Does it smell like the ocean? Maybe it smells like fresh pine. Now step outside and get into your dream car. Where are you driving to? Are you editing content from a glass office you built in the forest? Are you and your friends or family creating content at a tropical luxury resort? Let the feelings sink in like it's all already happened. Now open your eyes. This is a practice you could spend hours doing to get more clear on your vision in life. I find this especially useful during the challenging seasons when I need a reminder of why I'm putting in all the hard work. You can really get lost in the details of what you're doing when you get to work, who you're working with, what you do on your lunch breaks. It's endless. No doubt when you're imagining the goals you could actually see your dream kitchen. You could picture your house or your workspace. Now we're going to find images that match those goals and create something that you can look at every day as a visual reminder, a vision board. So you're going to search for the photos on Google and create a collage that you can put somewhere you'll see every day. Mine is on my phone but it could be on the desktop background or a printout on your bathroom here. We're going to do one together so you can see what I'm talking about. We're going to be using Canva which is a free tool for creating graphic designs. It's super easy so you should have no problem following along. Things to include could be your home, your transportation, your travel plans, your clients, your bank account, or your following. So there's a story that stuck with me for years about someone who created a vision board early in his career. He looked at it every single day but eventually completely forgot about it. Years later he was moving homes and his son ran up to him with the vision board that he found in a dusty old box asking what it was. The man broke down in tears because the dream house on the board was the house that he was moving into. Not a similar looking house but literally the exact home that he was unpacking boxes in. There is so much power in taking this seriously. It might feel irrelevant to content creation but I promise these goals are going to be rocket fuel for your motivation and the work that you do. It's important to remember that you don't need to know exactly how you're going to make your big dreams a reality. It's like driving through the fog. You only need to be able to see six feet in front of your car to keep driving but you always get where you want to go. That's why it's important to set small goals to guide the way. These are called smart goals. An acronym for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound. Let's say a goal on your vision board is to have a million followers. An example of a smart goal is growing 10,000 followers in the next 30 days. It's specific, measurable, achievable, or even modest, relevant because it works towards your dream goal and time bound for 30 days. These goals will be moving targets when you achieve one, celebrate the win, and set a bigger goal. Make sure they're always at least a little uncomfortable. If your goals are feeling unrealistic because you don't work for yourself, I want you to remember that the value you create in the world will always come back to you. You can become so valuable to the company you work for that they won't be able to say no to your request to take a month and work from a yacht in the Caribbean. Now you need to imagine the type of person who is living your dream life. Chances are you need more energy, more self-discipline, or more experience to get there, which leads into our next lesson. Have it.
