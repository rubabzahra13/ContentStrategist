 In this lesson, I'm going to be showing you one of our most requested tutorials and that is how to do the comment grab, which looks something like this. Here are the seven best transitions. Pretty cool and not too complicated. The technique to do this is called masking. But before we get there, the first thing that you need is a cardboard cutout with your comment on it. This is just like grade one arts and crafts. The first one that we did was actually just paper. I didn't even use cardboard. But I have included a link in the description here to a canva template, which has the comment on it. This is what it looks like. You can actually go into this template, whether or not you have a free or paid account, and you can update these fields with whatever you want your comment to be. You can also change out the photo. And from there, you're going to hit share, go download as PDF for print, download it. And then you can just print it with any printer. Our printer is actually black and white. And we've done all of ours black and white and nobody notices their care. So you can use literally any printer. Once you print that out, you're just going to cut it out, glue it to a piece of cardboard. So you have something that looks like this super simple. The other thing you're going to need is a PNG file of this that you're going to put into your video. If you have a canva pro account, you're able to just download this as a PNG and just check the transparent background. If you're going to go that route, I recommend you just take off the border here. That way it's going to show up exactly how it normally would in Instagram or TikTok without a border as a comment. If you don't have or want a pro canva account, I have also included a blank graphic template below. And I'll show you how we're going to build that out inside DaVinci. What you're going to need is a tripod shot. Ideally, the light will stay the same as well. This is a challenging one to do outside. If there's a lot of cloud movement or the sun is going down because if the sun moves too much or shadows change, this isn't really going to work. So it's also ideal to do indoors. If you are doing it outdoors, pro tip, just try and do it as fast as you possibly can so that the light doesn't change while you're doing this. You're going to understand what I mean very soon. So we're going to start the shot here. We're going to hit four for the endpoint press play. Then we're going to hit five and we're going to hit six and drop it into the timeline here. So now you have the clip with my hand. I'm going to show you how to take the hand out. So you're going to go back to this clip and you're going to grab a bit of this space before the hand comes in. We're just going to take the video part of it without the audio, which you can do by hovering over this here and dragging that right over top. If you click on D, you can toggle this clip on top so you can see it with and without. And you can see that this space is the exact same. So what we're going to do is with the clip on top highlighted, you're going to click into the color tab, which is this one down here. Now right click in this empty space and click add alpha output. You'll see this little blue dot just came up right here and you're going to drag from the blue square to the blue dot. What that's doing is it's making it so that when we cut it out, you're only going to see the part that we cut out. Okay, now what you're going to do is you're going to click on this pen tool in the bottom left hand corner of the screen and you're just going to draw a square somewhere around here. Okay, so now you can see my hand is being covered up by the frame over top already pretty cool. You'll see there's this soft one right here. If you pull this to the right, what that's going to do is it's going to add a little bit of feathering, which means that the line isn't going to be quite so harsh. So that's going to make your job a little bit easier. Now we're going to do something called key framing. So this is where it gets a little bit complicated, but once you understand the concept, it's super straightforward and it's going to be helpful for a lot of other things in the future. So what you're going to do is click on this right here next to where it says correct or one. So now it's going to happen is when we move this, we're going to see these triangles show up right here. And what that's doing is it's saying that at this point in time, this is where that box should be. So I'm just going to show you if I move to the end of this clip and I drag this all the way over here. That box is going to slowly move across the screen as time goes on. Obviously not what we want to do, but hopefully that helps you understand what's going on here. So I'm going to come in Z, go back to where we were before. So what you're doing now is you want to remove the hand anywhere that you can see it. So right now I can see a little finger here. So I'm going to click there and I'm going to drag it over so the finger disappears. So now I'm going to pull it back. That's great. I don't want it to be covering her hair. So I'm going to pull it back. You can see my hand here. So we're just going to make sure that it's covering my hand. You can see it's a little bit over her now. So we're going to pull this back. There we go. That's it. So now if you go back to the timeline and you watch this through, the hand has disappeared. Pretty cool. So how do you make this look like she's actually grabbing a comment? Because obviously this doesn't look good right now. If you did have a can of a pro account and you were able to download the file as a PNG with a transparent background, you're going to take that and you're just going to drag and drop it right over top here. If you don't have a can of a pro account, there's going to be one extra step which I will walk you through right now. You're going to use the blank file that I put in the downloads here. You're going to click on it and you're going to drop the zoom right down. You want to just cover the fake one that's in here. Next what you want to do is you want to go effects, then titles and text. Click on text and drag it over top here. Now we're going to change the color to black and we're going to type whatever we want in here. How do you do those transitions? Now we're going to size this way down. We are going to click on the left alignment here and we're going to move the position over with this one. The font that's actually in Instagram is called Proxima Nova. That's what I'm going to use here but if you don't have that, you can either find Proxima Nova online or you can just use a similar font. Now what we're going to do is we're going to do the same thing. Drag the text above and we're going to put replying to Business Guide 42. Then the color for this one when you click on the color box is just going to be a bit of a medium gray here like this. We're going to make that Proxima Nova again and drag that right down here so that it's in line. It's going to look something like this. Once you have your comment looking how you want it, what you can do is drag until the moment that she grabs the comment. Right here is going to be the first one and we're just going to pull all three of these graphics all the way back. It's just going to be disappearing as soon as she grabs it. Now if we watch it through, you'll see not bad. It looks okay but there's a few ways to make this look even better. The biggest problem that we're having right now is this is a perfect white and this one is a bit of a darker blue. We're going to highlight these three clips here and we're going to right click and we're going to go new compound clip. Create. Now what that does is it just puts all three of those into one file. Once you have it clicked, press on the color tab again down here and then we're going to add color to this. If you click on this circle with the dot in the middle down here, we're going to do the same thing that we did before with the keyframes. Now we're going to change the color as time goes on. You're going to press this diamond right there and we're going to pull the playhead back to the beginning. We're just going to make it a touch darker and you can see that the triangles appeared right here, meaning that it recorded that keyframe. Now we're going to go to the end of the shot and now we're going to pull this slider down which makes that comment darker as time goes on. We're also going to take this and we're just going to move it a bit into the blue. As you can see, it's a bit more similar now to the comment behind. If you drag this back and forth, you can see it goes from perfect white darkening as time goes on. Now back to the timeline. You can see the comment peeks out from underneath a little bit. You're going to want to hold that comment as still as possible. I have kind of shaky hands so to get around that, we're just going to make this graphic a little bit bigger and just pull it down so that it's covering our fake graphic. Now we're actually looking pretty believable and you could just stop there and you would have a great effect. But I'm going to show you one more step further if you want to make this even more believable. What we're going to do here is we're going to take this bottom clip here and if you're on Mac, you're going to hold option and just drag it to the top. That is just a quick way to duplicate a clip and take it to the top. If you're on a PC, I think it might be command, but it might be option. One of those two will help you to duplicate that track and then what we're going to do is when her fingers go over top of the comment. So you can see here her fingers come just over top. So while this is selected, we're going to go into the color tab again and we're going to do more masking. So what that means is in this blank space right click and click add alpha output. Drag from that blue square to the blue circle and now we're going to go to this circle again with the four dots around it and the pen tool. So this is all the same stuff that we did before, but we're adding a new clip on top and this time we're going to select around her fingers. Just like that. We're going to increase the softness so it's not as harsh of a line. Now we're going to do the same thing as we did before and we're going to click this diamond until it turns red. We're going to adjust this just a little bit so that these diamonds come up here and that shows that the keyframe is recorded. So now we can move ahead just a little bit and you can see her fingers moved. So we're going to move our adjustment over top of her fingers here. And there's none there. So now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our timeline. We're going to hit W and we're going to delete the beginning of this track and we're going to start this right where her fingers come in right there. So you can see the track starts after this frame as soon as your finger comes in it starts here. You could spend a lot more time and make this a way cleaner line but for now this shows the idea. And when it's only a couple of frames it's something that is almost subconscious that you only pick up if you're scrubbing through frame by frame but it does add to the believability of the shot. So let's give this another watch there. So that is how you do the comment grab and the biggest thing that I want you to take from this isn't so much how to do this specific effect but it's understanding the power of masking. So if you're using a tripod with the power of masking you can make anything disappear from the frame and you can add anything into the frame that you want. So an example of something else you can do with masking is a video that we did where we wanted to put con inside the fridge in a farm. Here's what I mean. What's a farmer doing in my fridge? Well it's not just a farmer. I got a whole farmer in here. You want to see? Okay. Let me guess. First time following through a fridge portal. So using the same things that you just learned we took con from the farm we masked around him and we put him inside of the fridge. So let's just one more way that you can use masking to add a bit more flair to your videos but if you scroll through a creator like Zach King you'll see thousands of other ways that masking can be used to take your videos to the next level. And I'm sure your mind is already racing so I cannot wait to see what you create. Drop it in the Facebook group if you decide to use any of these techniques just because I would love to see it and I will see you in the next one.
