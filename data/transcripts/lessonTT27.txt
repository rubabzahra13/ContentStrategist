 Welcome to the video ad Academy. Throughout this program, we're going to be teaching you how to create ads that not only convert into sales, but that people actually want to watch. Whether you've been scared to take the leap and get started on your ad journey, or you're spinning your tires, wondering why social media ads feel like the pit where you burn all your money, this course is going to help you to create ads that drive millions of revenue and can bring you a steady stream of new customers and raving fans on auto. From scripting a relatable narrative to capturing footage that tells a story, or editing for that perfect pace, you'll have it all down. And the best part, you'll learn how to keep refining, testing, and iterating so your ads don't just perform well once, they keep on killing it, driving results, and filling your pockets. All while entertaining your customer base and building brand equity, it's literally a win-win for everybody involved. We hear people say every day, my industry is too serious, being on camera is intimidating, I just don't have the budget, or ads won't work for me. We are here to smash those limiting beliefs and give you the tools to finally break through and resonate with your ideal audience. And if a lack of an ad budget is what's holding you back, know that we started our own journey spending just $30 a day. We had never spent a dime on marketing our business before, so the thought of dumping money into the ad abyss was pretty scary. But by simply turning $1 into 2 on repeat, we've been able to scale our business to over seven figures a month in revenue, using nothing but ads. We've even had one single video work so well that we've been able to put millions of dollars of ads spend behind it over the last year, and it still hasn't slowed down. Now we're gonna be giving you the exact step-by-step framework that we've refined over the last two years so you can achieve the same results with your ads. But more on that in a minute. Okay, so that was a lot of hype about our ads. But why the hell should you trust us with your ad journey? As a team, we've created ads that have driven hundreds of millions of dollars in sales for everything from online education and services to direct to consumer products. After creating and testing literally thousands of videos, we've learned tools, tactics, and fundamentals that apply across the board no matter what you're selling. These are methods that can be used by absolutely anyone. Even if you've never made a video in your entire life. In a world where ads can be skipped in milliseconds, and everyone is aware that they're being sold, it has never been more important to provide potential customers with value and a great reason to watch your ads. By enrolling in this course, you'll be cruising past the ad performance of some of the largest brands on the planet, who are still stuck on the old way of creating video ads. So, how did we learn this framework? In 2019, we were running a video production company creating what we call RoopDeeDews for some of the largest brands in the world. If you are unfamiliar with the term, because we made it up, a RoopDeeDew is a beautiful video with absolutely zero substance. They are cinematic beauty shots paired with meaningless voiceovers that jam a product down the viewers throw. It might look pretty, but it doesn't do anything to make the viewer care about the brand. But, because ads weren't skipable until the mid-2000s, this type of ad has been the centerpiece of video advertising for decades. And after years of creating ads like this for brands, we knew there had to be a better way to not only get a viewer's attention, but hold on to it and also make them convert. We discovered that by entertaining and educating audiences with ads, they not only stayed engaged for longer, but they actually wanted to be served our ads. We could take someone from having never heard of a brand to knowing and trusting it all within minutes. And, all well-feeling entertained. This journey really took off for us in 2020. When the world shut down and all of our production work was cancelled, we committed to creating a new ad every day for our favorite brands. Within a week, we had the attention of people like Ryan Reynolds and had more brands in our inbox than we ever could have imagined. We took everything that we learned, making ads so engaging that they could get millions of views even without any ad spend and applied the lessons to our own digital product, introducing an incredible media buyer. Within 12 months, we went from launch to 80,000 students and over a million dollars a month in revenue with just a handful of great ads. We did it with an extremely simple goal to turn $1 into 2, as many times as we possibly could. When we launched, we were putting $30 a day into ads and getting $60 in return. So, we increased budgets, creating new ads along the way. Before we knew it, we were spending $20,000 every single day on ads and bringing over 40,000 back in revenue. When we realized how life-changing great ads combined with a great product can be, we decided to put everything we learned into a course to help you. And here we are now. And, in order to create the most well-rounded course on ads possible, we decided to bring in the expertise of someone who has experience taking a physical product from 0 to $100 million dollar valuation with ads. Plus, has a decade of experience working with influencers and UGC style ads, which brought us to the incredible and talented tests. I'm Tess. And I spent the last five years mastering the art and science of high performance video advertising. During my time as a corporate creative director at Lomi and Pila, I had the honor of building and training a team that was laser-focused on one thing. Making incredible ads, like the Avengers of advertising, the AdVengers. Anyways, my team and I were responsible for a video campaign to introduce a brand new product to the world. And that campaign went on to receive millions of dollars of ads ban and eventually help us surpass a $100 million dollar valuation. After the success of that launch a couple years ago, I left my position as creative director to consult for a number of direct to consumer brands and start my own video agency, where I'm building another team of creatives and providing world-class ads to our diverse list of clients. From skincare products to travel agencies to biotech, we've made a nod for that. Somewhere in the middle of all of this, the team at one peak said, we're getting a lot of requests for a course on ads. Would you be down to help teach all those wicked smart systems you use to train your team of super creators? And since I'm here, obviously you know, I said, f*** yeah. So with all of that being said, I'm genuinely so honored and excited to be here and share everything I've learned about creating awesome ads with you. Whether you want to create ads for your own product or service or you want someone to pay you to create for theirs, we're about to tell you everything you need to know about performance creative and the tools and strategies that make an impactful ad.
