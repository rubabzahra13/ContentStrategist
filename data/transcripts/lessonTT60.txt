 In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to do a frame extension like this using Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve. I'll start by saying this is a little bit more complicated of a tutorial than the previous ones in this series, but if it's something you want to learn, it's pretty straightforward. So let's dive right into it. First thing is you need to make sure that it's shot using a tripod. So let's dive right into DaVinci and I'll show you what I mean. Right now we have a shot of Meg that's on a tripod. So as you can see, there's no movement in the background at all. And what we're going to do is we're going to click into the color tab right here and we're going to right click on the image. I want you to click grab still, right click on that and go export. We're going to export it as a PNG. You can name it anything you want. I'll call it Meg and click export. Now what this is doing is it's going to be exporting this still frame as a PNG to your downloads on your computer. As I mentioned, you need Photoshop for this to work. So let's open that right up. I think they have a seven day free trial if you want to try this out after that. I think they offer your subscription of just Photoshop as well for, I want to say 15 bucks a month. So if this is something you're going to use often for a studio setup or something like that, 100% worth it. We use this all the time and it is incredible. So once you have Photoshop open, we're just going to drag in the shot of Meg. We're going to zoom right out and we're going to click on the crop tool on the left hand side right here. Now we're going to drag this out pro tip. If you hold option and shift, it'll keep the canvas right in the middle. If you're on PC, I think that might be option shift. So we're going to drag it out as far as you want to go. Now we're going to hit generate and see what it gives us just right off the hop. Honestly, pretty terrible. Depending where you shoot this, if it's like a forest something like that a lot of the time, this first pass will actually be pretty good. But because this isn't looking great at all, we're going to get it to make something else. So what we're going to do is we're going to hit this last so tool right here. We're just going to circle around Meg here. You want to make sure that any movement in the video happens within this circle. And then you're going to right click and go select inverse. So what that does is it selects everything around her and hit generative fill. So now you can type in anything you want. So let's say turn this into beautiful office space with big windows over looking city. And then we're going to hit generate. Let's see what it does. Not great. Not terrible. Oh, that's that's quite a bit better. So it's going to give you three options and you can cycle through them like this. The more you try this, the more likely you are to have something that you're actually really happy with. If you want to specifically change one section like these desks look absolutely terrible. I'm just going to highlight those. And I'm just going to hit generative fill again. And we're just going to see if it comes up with something better for that. Yeah, honestly better with just nothing there. Okay, so let's say that we are so happy with how this looks. Now what we're going to do is we are going to go file, export, export as and export. We're going to call this something different. I'm just going to put a two at the end because I am extremely disorganized as you can probably tell by looking at the downloads folder in this tutorial. So now we're going to come back here. We're going to go over to the timeline. And we're going to take that file that we just put in and we're going to drag it into the timeline right here. Now we want to take our actual video file and drag it over top of the PNG. So now what we need to do is cut out Meg in this video files. If you've watched the other videos in the series, you'll already know how to do this, but I'm going to walk you through it. Click on the color tab. Right click in this space here. Go add alpha output. Hit the square, drag it over to the blue circle. What this is doing is it's going to make it so that when we do cut it out, the background will be transparent. So now we're going to click into this circle with the four dots around it right here. And we're going to click on this pen tool. Now we're going to drag around here. We just want to make sure that this is a little bit tighter than the selection that we made in Photoshop. So I'm just going to click around her like this. Okay, so now looks absolutely terrible. Of course, but we're just going to zoom out until we can line it up with the image here. And already looking really solid. That right there is pretty good. So now if we watch this clip back, pretty good. Now this is an example that isn't actually super practical, but an example of this that we found extremely useful is when we're doing sit-down interviews like this, because I can turn this space into something more like this. And it actually feels realistic. It feels like we're in a different space than we are. In the past, we've actually shot lessons for this course in the garage next to my house. And while there's been a mess everywhere, we were able to do a frame extent. So what looked like we were shooting in a big warehouse rather than a tight little messy space. One more thing to take this to the next level is if you drag this so that these are the same size, highlight both the PNG background and your video clip right click and go new compound clip go create. Now you've put these into one clip, meaning what you can do is when you zoom in on one, it zooms in on both at the same time. So it adds to the effect if you can do something like the dynamic zoom. So if you click on this here and then open it up and go swap. Now it'll do zoom into your shot. And it just feels a little bit more realistic because it feels like there's a camera moving and it's a little bit more interesting. And that is the frame extent. If you decide to use this effect, I would love to see how you use it, drop it in the Facebook group and I will see you in the next one.
