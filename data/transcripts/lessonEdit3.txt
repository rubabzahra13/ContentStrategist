 In this video, I'm going to show you how to take music or audio from social media and import it into DaVinci so that you can edit to the sounds. This can be extremely valuable whether you just want to see how the music feels with the piece of content or you want to actually edit to the beat. So let's get right into it. The first thing you want to do is go and find the song that you're looking for. So I'm going to look up how about espresso. So we're going to go to audio. Now this is in Instagram, but this also works with TikTok, Facebook, anywhere you want to get your music from. So what we're going to do is we're going to turn the volume up and you're going to screen record. If you've never screen recorded before, just give it a quick Google. If you're on Apple to make it super easy and pretty sure Android has a simple screen recording program as well. Then once you're screen recording, we're just going to hit play on the audio and we're going to let it play all the way through. So once you've done that, we're going to go and we're going to find that clip in our downloads. For me, I like to just air drop it straight to my computer, but follow whatever process you would normally do to take clips from your phone to your computer. So that could be Google Drive, We Transfer, Air Drop, whatever is easiest for you. And once you have it saved on your computer, you're just going to take the file for me. It's in my downloads and you're going to drop it right into your media pool, which is this folder here where all your clips are. And you're going to go through and you're going to find it and you're going to double click on it. Then you're going to click on this audio signal right here and you're going to drag that underneath all of your clips here. Once that's there, I'm going to zoom in a little bit and I'm going to remove this empty space at the beginning and then I'm going to take it and drag it to the beginning of the clip. Something to keep in mind is this is always going to be way too loud when you first drop it in. So you take the volume and just turn it way down until it feels like it's not competing with the speaking in the video. So now you have the audio in DaVinci and you can edit it directly to the music. You can also hit this lock button right here and that way anytime you're cutting the track or moving things around, it's not going to move that audio around, which can definitely be helpful. And once you're all done editing to the track, there's two ways that you can post this. So if you were to upload this track as is right now, it would most likely get removed from TikTok or Instagram because it would get flagged for copyright. So how to avoid this is when you are uploading the video, you want to add that sound how you normally would, but then you want to go into the volume and turn the added track all the way down, leaving the original audio all the way at the top. So what this does is you are telling Instagram or TikTok that you're using that track, so it isn't going to remove it. The other way that you can do this, if that makes you a little bit nervous, is you can just delete the audio from DaVinci. You can export it without the music and then you can add the music in how you normally would. Either way works great. That is how to add audio from social media to DaVinci. We do this every time because we like to know how the music feels while we're doing the edit and we encourage you to do the same. So I hope you enjoyed that, kept it short and sweet and I will see you in the next one.
