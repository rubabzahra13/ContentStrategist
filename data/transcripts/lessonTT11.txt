 The final piece of this content creator puzzle is probably the reason you're here. Getting paid to create and do the things you love to do. I'll break this lesson into two sections. First, we'll go over the three different ways you can get paid to create content. And then we'll discuss how and when to integrate partnerships into your content in a way that feels seamless and your audience will truly enjoy. So they're not just like cringy ads. You can also find a best business practices PDF attached that will cover every extra little detail and help you through any roadblocks you come across through this process. That is attached in the lesson description. Now that you've mastered content creation and you're climbing the algorithm, your time has come to monetize. This can feel pretty overwhelming when you don't know where to start. So I'm going to break down the three most common ways creators get paid by brands. On TikTok. Number one, sponsored content. This is the most common way for creators to monetize their videos. Brands will usually reach out to work with the creators and produce sponsored content that promotes their products or services. So this can take the form of branded video, a product review, or a tutorial that showcases the brand. But ultimately the goal is to have the content feel like it positively showcases the brand's value in a way that still makes sense on the creators channel. Creators are typically paid a flat fee for this type of content or they might receive a commission based on the number of clicks, views, or conversions generated by the post. This is paid for performance and it's not as typical as a flat fee. Another form of payment is an energy exchange where the creator makes content in exchange for a brand's product or service. For example, I've agreed to an energy exchange with a local golf course where I create content like this where my mom is my caddy for one whole. The video highlights just how beautiful the courses in a way that doesn't feel like a direct sell. In exchange for these videos, Tower Ranch has offered me a membership that would have otherwise cost me around $5,000. We were able to create an agreement that's mutually beneficial for both of our brands and it doesn't even feel like an advertisement. Viewers just genuinely enjoy the content. Number two, affiliate marketing. This is where brands partner with creators on affiliate marketing campaigns. In this type of partnership, the creator promotes the brand's products or services to their followers using a unique affiliate link. Then when a follower clicks on the link and makes a purchase, the creator earns a commission on that sale. There are a ton of platforms that offer affiliate marketing, the largest, most common, and well-known obviously being Amazon. Here's an example of how that works for Meg. She posted this video of Glenn exposing her organization obsession as she sifts through her Tupperware drawer, sorting the lids into a new divider. It was relatable for her audience because most of them have a Tupperware drawer that's overflowing and out of control. But it also introduced them to a solution to this issue in a funny and playful way that was just fun to watch and be a part of. Her followers are able to go to the link in her bio and get one for themselves, paying Meg a commission in the process. Now obviously she's not going to make a living selling this one Tupperware organizer, but she doesn't have to. Because whenever someone clicks the link and buys the product, she also makes a commission on any other purchases they make in that same visit to Amazon. That could be a blender, a TV, a book, or all three of those things combined. And more. Combine that with the fact that Meg will continue creating similar videos for an array of different products and over time she will have a very profitable affiliate program. Number three, brand licensing. This can also be considered a free sample model and it's a strategy we've used to grow not only as creators but also as a business. This is where a brand sees a video you've already created on your TikTok featuring their product and offers to buy licensing rights to run it as an ad for their own marketing initiatives. We've done this several times with major brands like PDLite, Old Navy, and Lomi with some deals coming in over $10,000. This is a great way to practice honing your creative skills in a way that can also benefit you in the long run. And if there's a dream partnership you have in mind, it can be an excellent way to get their attention. That covers the main three ways we regularly get paid to create content. So let's go over how and when to find your first partnership starting with how. There are two ways you can make this work. The second of which will require a little more salesman ship and pizzazz. Option one is build it and they will come root. This is what's worked really well with my golf channel and led to having dozens of different brands reaching out to do business within my first couple months of creating content. Essentially with this method you just focus all of your effort on creating the best content possible and growing your audience with no expectation of payment for any of the work that you're doing. As you begin to find your voice and grow an audience, there will be designated employees at brands who reach out with an offer. This may seem too good to be true, but here are a few DMs I've received in the last month to emphasize my point. I didn't contact any of these companies. All I did was make the best damn content I could and they came looking for me. Option two is ask and you shall receive. But if you want to receive, you'll have to have something to give. I would recommend going this route if you already have a brand in mind that you know you want to work with. Whether that be your local golf course in exchange for T times or your favorite outdoor brand in hopes of a long-term partnership. Either way, you'll have to show them why it's worth their time and money. To do this, try to find valuable ways to showcase their product in your video in a way that feels true to your channel and you know your audience will love. Here's an example of how we use this method to get the attention of our favorite Canadian celebrity Ryan Reynolds. At the time he was the owner of Aviation American Gym. We knew him to be a relatable, sarcastic, and extremely funny person. So we thought to ourselves, how can we use Ryan Reynolds voice alongside our creativity to get his attention? Our area of expertise wasn't creating ads. At the time we were doing a challenge where we created them in 24 hours and documented the entire experience. So we decided to use one of his voice clips to build out an ad campaign. The morning after posting it, we had comments from Ryan, his wife Blake Lively, and his brand Aviation American Gym. Now this never materialized into a working relationship with Ryan Reynolds, but it did get us a ton of PR and hundreds of emails from brands literally around the world who wanted to work with us to create ads for them. The lesson here is that often when you go this route, you'll face rejection and things won't go exactly as you planned. But when you put your best work out there and highlight what you're capable of, it's always sure to bring in new opportunities. We've tested and proved this so many times. The other way to use the Ask and You Shall Receive method is exactly as it sounds. Find the right people and pitch your idea. If you're going to try this method, it's important to have a solid presentation prepared, including your objective, the value you can offer, and how you'll measure its success. They're going to want to know what's in it for us. Start by doing some research on the brand you'd like to work with and trying to find the decision maker. They'll usually be a marketing manager or director. Depending on the size of the company, you may be able to find an email directory online. But if not, you can always send a DM on social media or sometimes even make a phone call to introduce yourself. Seems bold, but it's a good way to get your foot in the door. This method probably seems pretty daunting, especially if you've never had this type of sales interaction before, but don't worry. We've attached an example pitch deck template along with a guide to the perfect pitch in the lesson description so you can feel confident. Now that covers how we tend to find our partnerships. But when is it time to monetize? The answer for this is different for everyone, depending on your goals with content creation. If you're just looking for a way to offset the cost of your hobby as soon as possible, but don't care about a career beyond that, then you can start working in partnerships as soon as you're comfortable with creating the content, which is probably pretty much right now. But if your goal is to have a long-term career and a personal brand within the creator economy, you may want to consider holding off a bit until you've developed a large following, consistent engagement, and a true brand voice. This is the method I've been taking so far on my golf channel. My goal is to eventually create my own clothing line and potentially even a hospitality business in the golf world. So I want to be able to focus on building my brand to be recognizable and consistent, and I feel it's important to have creative control in order to do that. With that being said, I've still been able to offset the cost of a membership and coaching because I found an amazing partnership who understands my vision, and that's something that you can definitely do too. Hopefully with this insight, you're able to determine where you stand. If you're ready to get paid, go get that bread. And if you're holding off for now, I'm so stoked to see where you take your channel. Thank you so much for taking the time to improve your lifestyle and trusting our advice.
