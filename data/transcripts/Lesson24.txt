 Before you can hit record and film your video, there are two more steps that will help make you feel more prepared as your production day gets closer. And that's creating a storyboard and developing a shot list. These steps of the pre-production or planning phase are most common for creative skip. But I cannot stress how important they are to understand and then utilize when needed. I'm going to take this lesson to walk you through storyboarding. Why it is such an important part of the creative process, when you may need one, and then how you can create one for yourself. Let's answer this question. Why should you storyboard? A storyboard is a great tool to organize and outline the flow of your narrative. Think of it as a sort of comic book version of the video you are going to create. It's the roadmap that will guide you and others involved through the production process. By planning your video in this format, you will know which specific shots you need to create and how you are going to capture them when your filming begins. If a storyboard can be helpful if you want to feel more prepared on your production days, you want to speed up the filming process or you need to share your visions with others in more detail. Now to be clear, you may not always need a storyboard for every piece of video content that you create. For example, if you are recreating a quick TikTok trend, a storyboard probably isn't required. But for those video concepts that are a little more complex or when there are multiple parties involved in the process, it can be a super helpful tool to have on hand. And if it hasn't happened already, the day will come when either your boss or a creative director for a big brand will reach out and say, I love the creative brief you put together. Can you send over a storyboard? So understanding this process and knowing how to create one for yourself will leave you ready for that moment. Now I understand you have a lot on your plate as a creative and developing a storyboard might just feel like another daunting step to the creative process. But I promise this quick creative tool is going to be super helpful and leave you feeling so much more confident as you head into your production day. How to create a storyboard. So now you're probably wondering how in the heck do I create one of these things? Well, I'm happy to report that it is a fairly simple process. In a nutshell, your storyboard will use a combination of visuals, either photos or sketches and supporting texts to outline your vision. Lay it out in a linear format. Each box of your storyboard will help break your concept into easily digestible chunks for others to follow along. I want to be clear right from the start that there is no wrong way to create a storyboard. Everybody does it differently. Some people prefer to put pen to paper and sketch out each scene, while others like to find photo references online and build it out that way. Now I myself am a horrific artist. My stick people look like trees and my dogs look like cars. So I personally prefer to create my storyboards on the computer using stock images that I find online. This approach might not be as accurate as customally drawing it yourself, but I'll take having you use a little bit of imagination over my chicken scratch any day. Now if this digital creation process is for you, there are a number of ways you can go about doing it. If you have a knack for graphic design, you could use programs like Adobe Illustrator or Adobe InDesign, but you could also use Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or if you are more comfortable with those programs. There are also a number of online storyboard tools as well, like storyboarder or studio binder. Here at One Peak, we've grown to like storyboarderbest, which is actually a free program. So today, Kahn is going to build out a storyboard in that program, which is hopefully going to leave you feeling more confident to create one of your own. What's up everybody? Welcome to my workspace. It is almost never this clean. Okay, let's get into some storyboarding. As Meg mentioned, the app that we use for storyboarding is called storyboarder. There's been a link included in the description so you can go ahead and download that now so we can work through this together. Now that you've got the app downloaded, we're going to go ahead and just open it up. On my app, you'll see that there's already been previous projects because we use this pretty frequently. So for you, this will all be blank, and all you have to do is start by clicking Create a New Storyboard. That's going to prompt you by saying there are two ways to create a storyboard, which would you like. Typically, we always do a blank storyboard. For this particular instance, we're shooting a video in standard definition, so 16 by 9, and that is what I've collected all the imagery for, so I'm going to select that option. However, if you're doing vertical or square or any of those other formats, you have the option to do that here as well. Now it's going to prompt you to title and save your storyboard somewhere. So we're going to title ours hearing loss clinic because that's the client that we'll be doing it for. And I've already created a project folder for this, so you'll do the same for your project. From there, we can just hit Create and we'll jump right into the user interface. As this app opens up, you can see there's all kinds of different tools. There's different drawing tools and erasers up at the top, different color schemes you can choose from. But what we'll mainly be using is just our imagery, and these boxes here on the right hand side to fill out maybe the duration of shot, what's happening, and any dialogue that's included. From here, it's really quite simple. You're going to open your project folder where you stored your project, and where you're storing your imagery for this storyboard. For me personally, I just pulled all of this imagery off Google because this is strictly internal and only for our use. We won't be selling it or monetizing it in any way. So you can probably do the same thing. And from here, all you're doing is importing your images seen by scene and filling out the information. So I'll show you how that works. Just grab your first image that's going to be the very beginning of your storyboard and drop it in here. As you can see, it's created a new slide here. So what we can do is just go ahead and delete this first one. And then as you continue dragging the men, they'll just keep creating new slides. So this is the very first scene of our story. So now what we want to do is fill in any dialogue that the character or narrator has here. And then also fill in camera angles, movements, and any actions that are being taken. So to give you guys some context, the storyboard that we're creating is for a company called the hearing loss clinic. And we've essentially created a story about a man and his best friend who ends up being a turtle. So our scene is going to be opening in a park on the day that those two met. The video will mainly be narrated by the main character in a voiceover style. So the dialogue in this is just his opening line, which is from the day we met. So next you'll fill out the action that was being taken. In our case, it's going to be medium push in on man walking through park. One final thing that you can add to get an idea for how long your video is going to be is the duration of the shot. You can either do that in seconds or in frames. So in our case, this is probably going to be about one second. So I'm just going to put 24 frames. And that is equal to one second or 1000 milliseconds. That's as simple as it is to create your first frame of your storyboard. The next slide that will be creating is simply the next shot in the video, which is going to be a tight on the turtle. So all I do now is go back to that same folder, grab my next shot, which is a tight of that turtle, drag it and drop it and it creates my next slide. Then in the storyboard, I just have to slide over to that next timeline and repeat this process. So our dialogue for this scene is we were inseparable. So the action being taken will be of the turtle and the grass, hopefully giving us some kind of reaction. So what I'll type here is tight on turtle and grass looking to cam. Now, we might not necessarily get a shot of the turtle looking to cam, but that's kind of the vision that we're going for and having that there helps us visualize what it is that we're looking for. I envision this shot probably also being about one second or 24 frames. Awesome. There's two shots done. Storyboard comes together this quick, opening up that project folder, bringing in the next shot, which is our hero, meeting the turtle for the first time. Okay, so the dialogue for this one is we did everything together and the action is just going to be a medium shot of our main character and the turtle in joined a moment together. So medium shot on man and turtle. Okay, now that's the first scene of this video. I want to remind you guys here that you don't have to actually input every single shot. At this point in the video, we'll probably have more like seven or eight shots, but we mainly just want to paint a picture of what this moment is going to look like for our audience. So now that you understand how this works, it's really just a rinse and repeat formula until you get to the end of your video. I'm not going to make you sit through all that because I feel like it would be redundant, but I am going to show you how to export this for PDF. So you can send it to people on your team or anybody else who needs to see it for the production. What's really neat about this app is there's actually options to export it as a PDF or you can even export it as an MP4. So what it does when you export it as a video or MP4 is it takes the timestamps that you put in and it makes each frame that length. So if somebody has a hard time visually seeing something just on PDF format, what you can actually do is have it in a slideshow version. So the scenes will take place in a roughly the same amount of time that you envision for the video. And if you want to give yourself a better idea, you can actually scroll back to the beginning of this playhead and play it through. And it's going to do it at exactly the time amounts that you put it. Okay, for this instance, we're just going to export it as a PDF because that's most functional for us and that's typically pretty much what we always use. We find that it's easiest to have a high level view of the entire video when we're on set so we can just quickly look at it and see wherever we are in the video without having to scroll through over and over. File, print or export to PDF. Okay, now it gives you some really basic formatting options. So you can choose your paper size, which is just between a4 or letter. Typically, we always leave it on a4. Paper orientation, because the video that we're shooting is landscape, we also make the paper landscape. But if you are shooting this vertical, you could have your paper and a portrait orientation as well. And then you choose columns and rows. So typically, when we have a lot more images than this, which you likely will, we'll choose to do three columns, which looks like this. And usually two, sometimes three rows. Three might get a little bit busy, so I think I would suggest probably doing three columns and two rows. Leave enough space on the sheet to understand what's going on without feeling too messy. Okay, so from there, all you're going to do is hit export PDF. And just like that, it's going to save in an auto-generated exports folder. What I would recommend here is taking that file and putting it with the rest of your project. So in future, when you want to come back to it, you know it's all in one place. Drag it from exports, put it in the file. Then you're done. You can open that up. And this is what it's going to look like. Super easy to understand. Everything's laid out. It's a great top-down vision of your video. This is something that you can share with your team. You can send to clients. And you can use on the day of your shoot to really make sure you're capturing all the scenes and everything you need from your video. I know a few of you are probably pretty curious as to how this storyboard and video turned out. So we've actually linked the finished video and complete storyboard in this lesson description. I really hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. Alright, that's it for me for now. So I'll see you again soon. Well there you have it. Hopefully you now understand the value of a storyboard and how to create one for yourself. We hope you take the time to add this practice to your process so you can feel more prepared as you head into your shoot days. As an activity, we'd now like for you to create a storyboard of your own for an upcoming project you are working on. To begin, take a little time to research the storyboard platform that is going to be right for you. Choose based on what is going to be easiest for you to work seamlessly into your creative process. Remember, there is no wrong way to create a storyboard. Use the format that is going to be the most digestible for you. Once you're done, let's head over to the next lesson where we dive into the importance of shot lists and how to create one. See you over there.
