 In this video, I'm going to show you how to add captions to your video, the most cost-effective way possible, which is using cap cut. This is a pro feature, so you get to use it five times for free, and after that it costs, I think, $15 a month or $150 a year, which if you're creating a lot of content, totally worth it, and if you don't want to be paying for a tool to caption your videos, just use the auto captions inside of TikTok or Instagram, and that will also work great. But if you do want to learn how to caption your videos, let's get into it. Once you have cap cut downloaded, we're going to hit create project here, and you're going to get a window that should look something like this. We're going to take your completed video file that you want to add captions to, and we're going to take it, and we're going to drag it right here where it says import. Once you've done that, you're going to take this and drag it into the timeline down here. Now with this selected, you're going to come up and click text up here in the top, and you're going to click auto captions and hit generate. Okay, now we have our captions, and they're coming up over top of the video. That's a great start, but it kind of looks like trash. To fix it, we're going to highlight all of these captions, and we're going to come up to the right here. First, we're going to make them bigger. Somewhere around there, we're going to switch the font. You can pick any font that you want. The biggest thing is you want to make sure that it's easy to read. So let's try pop-ins. That looks great. We're going to make it all caps. You don't have to, but I think that looks awesome, and we're going to make it a little bit bigger. You can add preset styles to this, so adding a stroke around the outside. This is going to make it a little bit easier to read. I wouldn't get too carried away with these. There's a lot of pretty wild options. I would just go nice and simple, something like that. Now we're going to move this up. If you scroll down in this text window, you'll see where it says position. Right now, it's at minus 1075. This is a little bit low because it could get cut off by the text that's here. So we're going to try minus 500. That looks about right right there. So let's play it back. This is looking good, but I personally like there only being a couple words on screen at a time. This is where it gets a little bit tedious, but I'll show you how to do it quickly. In this top right hand side where we were playing with the text, there's this where it says captions. You're going to click on that, and this gives you the transcription for your entire video. The one through in this captions tab, you can go through and just start to break these apart. So if you click one time in, it'll look like that, hit enter or return, and it'll just put it on a new space. If you want, you can make one word on each line, but I feel like two to three usually looks pretty solid. While you're doing this, you can also just make sure there's no typos, nothing that it transcribed improperly. And if you want to change the timing of any of these captions, you can just zoom right in here. You can change how long these last four or where they sit. Once that's exactly how you want it, we're going to go up to the top right here. We're going to click export. Right now you can only use it five times for free before they make you upgrade to the paid version, but if you love it and it's easy, then it is worth the investment. So right now we're going to go and we're going to hit export and we're going to let this load out. And just like that, we've got captions added to the video and they look great. If you do decide that you want to keep using this and upgrade, I think it's like 15 bucks a month, 150 bucks a year, something like that. Continue using all of the pro features inside cap cut, which if you're making a lot of content, totally worth it. And with that, I will see you in the next one.
