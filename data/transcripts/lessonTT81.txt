 Welcome in this course we're going to be showing you how we created launch and scaled a course to eight figures in our first full year gaining over 100,000 new customers in the process. There is going to be absolutely no fluff. So if you love fluff you're in the wrong place We did it all using one platform called Kajabi. It's where we hosted our website sales page email marketing check out payment processing literally everything. So if you haven't already go sign up for it now with our discount link in the last description So you can follow along through the rest of this course because we are going to be showing you how we set things up on the backend using our own Kajabi account The reason we love Kajabi is it's allowed us to hit eight figures with just three people a part-time customer service agent and a contract Media buyer not to mention in a year where I spent a couple weeks in Costa Rica Megan I had a baby and I spent a month in Europe with my wife on our honeymoon all this to say the systems were so automated that we could do a Million dollars a month in revenue while taking weeks off at a time a true golden goose of a business that wouldn't be possible Without Kajabi if you were to do your research what you're gonna find is that other platforms can do parts of the process better Klavio is a bit better for sending emails Sam Kart is a bit better for check out But we wouldn't be here now if we had spent all of our time in the beginning trying to integrate these platforms instead of Creating a product and figuring out how to sell it using more than one service becomes expensive Time consuming and there's a lot more that can break when you start doing volume Just trust me on this one pause the video and sign up for Kajabi This is a platform that we believe in so wholeheartedly that we've signed up to be a partner with them and in the lesson description You can get a discount link where we're gonna keep it up to date with the best possible price Okay, I can sum up our mentality towards course creation in four words create test iterate repeat which is exactly What will be teaching you throughout this course? Here's what that process has looked like for us in 2023 One peak was a video production company We talked to a friend who had made over a million dollars selling courses and we were so tired of trading our time for money and Dealing with clients we decided let's try it out so we created a course on video production It taught people how to make beautiful cinematic videos and when we tested selling it it did okay But we realized what people actually wanted was to learn how to get views on social media We were consistently getting millions of views for our clients on brand new accounts and we knew the structure for creating a viral video So we made a course teaching how to create videos that can get views and that course absolutely took off For every $55 we spent on ads we could get a customer who spent $110 so we spent five million dollars on ads and by the end of our first full year the course had brought in 10 million what I want you to take from our story is the road to a $10 million course is windy and it's probably not going to happen with your first kick at the can Or in the way that you had originally expected you just need to commit to the process take your best guess at what will work Create the product test selling it and iterate to give it the best chance possible Then you just repeat the process if you find a better direction You'll hear a lot of people saying that you need to pre-sell a course that hasn't been created to test and offer But in our experience if you want an offer to work you need to commit to it Even though our original video production course didn't work as a hero product that we could run on ads or sell beyond our small Existing audience we've sold over a million dollars of that course to people who bought our next offer as long as you stay in the same niche where you have Credibility everything you create can be sold to the same audience our mantra is success is the ability to go from failure to failure Without loss of enthusiasm and if you can do that you will never lose and we'll make sure you never lose because in this course We're going to teach you how to develop a 10 million dollar course offer How to decide how much to sell it for and how to actually create it then we'll take you into our kajabi account and show you the system to get 100,000 customers on autopilot from your sales page and check out to email strategy and brand and finally We'll show you the process that we use to get customers while we sleep with ads organic content affiliates and email marketing If you are new to the course creation space We've added a terms you need to know document to the download section of this lesson I highly suggest having you cruise through that to make sure you are all up to speed I told you there would be no fluff so let's dive into our first lesson
