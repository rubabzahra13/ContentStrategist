 In this video, I'm going to show you how to do the clone effect inside of DaVinci Resolve, which will look something like this. The clone effect. If you want to learn how to do all of these, this is a super simple effect so it should be a quick tutorial. So let's dive right into it. This is all going to be shot on a tripod and you need to do it in a location where you can have two people in the frame at once with enough space in the middle for a line. I'll show you what I mean in a second. What we're going to do is we're going to take the shot of Meg talking here and we're going to add it to our timeline. Then we're going to scrub through and we're going to find the shot of Meg walking in on this side. And we're going to drag that over top. So right now what you have is Meg on the right side on this clip here and then Meg on the left side on the clip underneath. So what we're going to do is we're going to drag the clip that's on the bottom onto the top. So that the clone that is closest to the camera is on top. Then what we're going to do is we're going to highlight that and we're going to click on the color tab down here. If you've watched some more of the tutorials in this series, this is all going to be familiar, but I'm going to get you to right click in this blank space here. Go add alpha output. Then you're going to drag from this blue square over to the blue circle there. Now what we're going to do is we're going to zoom out just a little bit here and we're going to click on the pen tool. What you want to do is separate the left and the right parts of this frame. How good of a job you do here depends a lot on how much the light change in the room while you are shooting this. So if you're shooting in a place where you have controlled lighting, then you actually don't have to be that close at all with this. But because I had big windows on the left side here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this line going down the top of the wall here because it's going to be a little bit less noticeable. You'll see what I mean in a second. And we're going to draw right down here, staying nice and close to Meg, and around her foot, and out of frame right there. And then this doesn't matter, so I'm just going to click off here like that. Now you can see we have Meg on the left side and Meg on the right side. Fantastic, but we're not quite done. What we're going to do is we're going to go down, we're going to click on this diamond right here so that it turns red. What this is doing is it's setting your keyframe. What that means is it's recording where these lines are at this moment in time. You'll see her hand goes just outside there, so I'm going to move this right there. And you can see that these diamonds just appeared there. So just so you can see what this is doing, I'm going to bring it over here and I'm just going to move this way off. Now as this goes on, that is going to move back to where it was. Hopefully that makes sense, I'm just going to hit Command Z. And now what we're going to do is we're going to go through and see if there's any spots where Meg is out of the frame. So you can see right here, this Meg is cut off just a little bit. So what we're going to do is we're going to find the exact spot where she comes in, right there. And we're going to drag this over to about here. So now that looks great. So if we come back here, let's give it a quick little watch there. So you can see her foot is getting cut off just a little bit right here, so we're going to have to actually be quite a bit closer. So we're going to move this just over here. And let's see when that started. We're going to zoom right in so we can see and we're going to move this over the more space that you give in between your two subjects that easier. This is going to be, I like to make it nice and hard for ourselves. So let's see what this looks like here. There we go. You can see her foot goes behind. So that means we need to pull this right over. We need to be really tight. If they were separated by a little bit more in the frame, you wouldn't have to go this close. But just to show you the toughest situation, this is what it looks like. Something else that you can do just to make this feel a little bit better is this softness tab right here. If you pull that up, it just smooths out that line. So you can see right around there, that line starts to disappear. So we're going to do that for each one of these. Depending on how close you are to the subject, is how much you can lift this. You start to get a little bit of ghosting if you get too high there. So usually somewhere around two or three gets rid of the line without making anything look bad. So now if we watch this back, there we go. Pretty good. If you've been working your way through the series, you probably noticed that earlier on, we used masking to get rid of the hand that's holding the comment. This is a situation where we're using masking to add somebody into the frame. But there's so many different ways to use masking, especially when you're shooting on a tripod. It's kind of magic. Thank you for watching. And I cannot wait to see how you use this. If you decide to clone yourself, drop it in the Facebook community and I would love to see it. I will see you next time.
