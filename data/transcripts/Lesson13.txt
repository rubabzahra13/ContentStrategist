 It's important to remember that as a content creator, you are your biggest asset. The bottom line is that if you aren't feeling your best, you won't be able to perform at your best and achieve your biggest goal. Creativity is a practice that requires a significant amount of energy, both mentally and physically. And as a creator, you are tasked with a number of high energy output tasks each day. Like brainstorming, pitching, set styling, acting, shooting, editing, launch plans, analytics, it can be a lot. The last thing we want as creators is to slip into a state of burnout or create a block, both of which can make you feel like you're moving backwards instead of forwards. So how do we ensure we are operating at our best? We aim to be in our best state every single day. And to do so, it's important to implement positive daily habits. In this lesson, I'm going to share the top five daily habits successful people implement and tricks to help you see them through. But before we can add new habits to our routine, we need to take some time to reflect on our current ones. To kick things off, I want you to really think about this next sentence I share. Where you are at today in life is the sum of your current habits. Ask yourself this. How happy or unhappy are you? How physically strong or physically weak are you? How successful or unsuccessful are you? Your responses to questions like these are all directly linked to the results of your current habits. It's understanding that the repeatable actions that make up your day, what you spend time thinking and doing, ultimately form the person that you are, the things that you believe and the personality you choose to show up with every single day. The big lesson here is that if you can take control of your habits, you can take control of your life. But before you can start implementing new habits, it's important to dissect your current ones. As a quick exercise, I want you to walk through your day and write down all of the current habits you perform and then categorize them as either positive or negative. As you do this, you might discover things you do daily that you may have not even considered being a habit. Things like brushing your teeth, hitting snooze, or watching TV with your dinner. Once you have your complete list, go through it and ask yourself if these actions are moving you forward or holding you back. Give yourself a check mark for the ones that are positively impacting you and give yourself an X beside the ones that aren't. Really get honest with yourself here and don't hold back. Here's an example of what my list looked like two years ago before I got control of my habits. Turn off 5am alarm. Hit snooze button twice. Grab phone and open emails. Get out of bed. Brush teeth. Drink a glass of water. Go for a run or to the gym. Take a shower. Make a cup of coffee. Skip breakfast. Drink another cup of coffee. Scroll social media. Eat packed lunch. Watch TV with dinner. Clean kitchen. Pack lunch for tomorrow. Read book. Journal. Scroll social media. Go to sleep at 10pm. Seeing my list on paper was a total wake up call. I got really honest with myself and realized that there were a number of actions that were not serving me and could be replaced with something more beneficial. An example of this was hitting snooze every morning. I would wake up exhausted at 5am and it would be a struggle to get out of bed. The obvious solution was getting a longer sleep. So I adjusted my bedtime to 9pm and the problem was solved. This exercise is a great tool to get familiar with your current daily habits and think about some of the changes you may want to make. Did it make you aware of some of the poor habits you want to ditch or spark ideas for future habits that you'd like to explore? Hopefully it was a combination of the two and you're ready to exchange your habits for success. Which brings us into our next section the 5 Daily Habits of Successful People. This following quote is from who I would consider one of the masters of habits. Tony Robbins. His words do a great job of summing up the ethos of successful people. Successful people are not born smarter or with more willpower. They don't have magical powers that allow them to get more done. They have developed daily habits to ensure they have the energy, time and the drive they need to accomplish their goals and beat their best selves. What an incredibly powerful statement. To sum it up simply, successful people are those with successful habits. And according to Tony there are 5 core daily habit areas to be aware of that are directly linked to the success of high performers. Strong morning rituals, set your intentions for the day, take care of your body, maximize your brain power and learn something. The specific habits you choose to form in each of these areas are totally up to you and it will be customized to your lifestyle. I am going to explain the importance of each and share some examples starting with strong morning rituals. Having a strong morning routine gives us the power to set the tone for our day. Kicking off the day by prioritizing tasks that will put us in a positive state both mentally and physically will lead to better focus, better decision making and ultimately increase our productivity. Having strong morning rituals allows us to control our state rather than letting our state control us. And as a result that positive energy trickles into all of our decision making, tasks and interactions that we have following after. Establishing a consistent morning routine that you know is going to set you up for success really is a secret superpower. So how do you get started? Well all you have to do is narrow down at least two to three habits that improve your mental and physical self and stack them at the beginning of your day. Here's a few examples of what some successful people's morning routines look like. Brock and Michelle Obama reportedly start their days with a 45 minute workout followed by a hot green cup of tea. Author and podcaster Tim Ferris begins his day with a meditation and five minutes of journaling. Taylor Swift or T-Swift starts our day with a cup of tea and toast then plays with their cats before a morning workout. Tony Robbins morning rituals consists of a workout, a healthy breakfast, meditation and a cold plunge. All four of these people are wildly successful. They may all start their day in a unique way but the point is they all have a strong morning ritual. I challenge you to figure out what two to three habits could make up your new daily routine and test this practice out. Number two is to set intentions for the day. The idea of intention setting might sound like something you'd only do at the beginning of a yoga class but it really is a powerful accountability tool that can help guide you through your day and reach your goals. Both big and small. They are a reminder of what you want to focus on and pinpoint the kind of energy you want to be a part of your day. Setting intentions can come in a number of forms such as meditation, journaling, manifestation or visualization. One option is not better than the other and what leads to the best results really varies from person to person. If this concept is entirely new to you I suggest testing this practice out with a guided journal. I personally love using the five minute journal which I will link in the lesson description and there's even a discount code there for you. It has been an easy practice to work into my morning routine and I love the accountability. Number three is to take care of your body. Think of your body as a vehicle. It's what drives you forward to help you accomplish all of your biggest dreams but in order to do so you need to keep up with the maintenance so it can operate effectively and avoid breaking down. Again this is going to look different for everybody but do your best to incorporate daily habits with the vehicle analogy and mind. Now I'm not here to sell you on some healthy special diet or specific workout plan for success. All you need to do is get honest with yourself. Look within and determine what makes your body feel and operate at its best. For me I do my best when I drink two liters of water a day, eat a ton of veggies and proteins and move my body for at least 45 minutes. Not every day is going to be perfect but the takeaway here is to discover your own formula and use it as your secret weapon for success. Number four is to maximize your brain power. This habit area was the greatest game changer for me personally and it started with this statement. Accomplish people don't have more brain power than the rest of us but they do know how to use their brains more effectively and once again I do have Mr. Robbins to thank for that one. The fact of the matter is everyone has their own mental limit. There comes a point where our brains just simply max out. The goal is to be in control of our brain power so it never gets to that point. So the million dollar question is how can you maximize your brain power instead of burning it out? Well really great first step is identifying the time of day when your brain functions at its best. I like to call this your productivity window. Now this again is going to be different for everybody and so for me I know that this window lands between 7 and 11 a.m. This is when I am the most focused where my creativity shines and I'm the most productive. So your goal is to identify this window for yourself and then structure your day around it. If you lump all of your most important tasks for the day during this window you have a significantly better chance of getting them done and performing them at a higher caliber. Another way to maximize your brain power is to remove all distractions when you're trying to be productive and this is a hard one. This may really seem like a no-brainer but things like scrolling social media, email notifications, internet tabs, loud music or interacting with coworkers are all a recipe for failure when it comes to staying hyper focused. Remove those and you have the best chance to stay in the zone. A necessary decision making also has a massive effect on maximizing your brain power. Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are great examples of this. Have you noticed that these two tech titans wear pretty much the same thing every single day? They intentionally choose to eliminate having to make the what should I wear today decision every morning and instead they buy 20 of the same shirt that they know is going to work for them. This is obviously an extreme example but being able to eliminate the unnecessary decisions in your life can open up more brain power. Understanding your productivity window, removing distractions and eliminating unnecessary decisions are just a few of the ways you can gain your brain power back and optimize it so it's working for you instead of against you. And number five is to learn the final daily habit area is to learn something every single day. Those who have reached the peak of success are obsessed with always knowing more because learning allows you to grow. And constantly growing is what's going to help lead you towards a more fulfilling life. That's some deep stuff right there. Now I'm not talking about taking up an entirely new hobby but instead allocating time towards things like podcasts or books, documentaries and courses which you seem to already have a finger on. Just as we have to fuel our bodies to keep them moving forward and functioning at their best, we also need to do the same for our minds and it's so easy to forget that. Start by dedicating just 10 minutes per day to keep your mind growing. Switch up the tool you choose to use and remember to have fun with it. So there you have it. Those are the five daily habit areas. Morning rituals, intention setting, taking care of your body, maximizing your brain power and learn something. Now I know that was a lot to absorb but if you can draw specific habits out of each of these five areas and then work them into your daily routine, you will be on your way to achieving success. As an exercise, take out a notebook and write the potential daily habits that fall under each area that could help you perform at your best. Some examples could be exercising, journaling, meditation, healthy meal planning, getting eight hours of sleep, keeping your home clean, getting an agenda or listening to a podcast. But the work doesn't stop there. You might be thinking, all right, I have determined the new habits that I want to implement from each of these areas, but how do I actually see them through? This is something a lot of people struggle with. Well, I do have some awesome tips up my sleeve and if you're willing to put them into action, I promise you will be able to do exactly that. So let's skip over to Habits Part 2 in the next lesson and get started.
