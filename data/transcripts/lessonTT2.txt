 In this lesson, I'm going to explain the creator economy, which I know sounds pretty lame, but it's actually really cool. We'll talk about how it works, the incredible financial and lifestyle benefits, and how you can play a role in it. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of exactly how you can provide value to this industry while doing the things you love to do. And actually, getting paid for it. Although creators and influencers have been around since the creation of social media platforms in the mid-2000s, my space, the creator economy is a term that has been rapidly growing in popularity and absolutely exploded in the last few years. So what does that mean? It's defined as a class of businesses built by over 50 million content creators, like social media influencers, bloggers, and videographers. Now, that's the definition, which is boring, but how about a real example to make it a little more clear? For the majority of the 1900s, media was controlled by large companies like Walt Disney and Fox News. This was mainly because the cost of producing videos was massive, and the barrier to entry was far too high for individuals. This meant that these few businesses made all of the money from major brands looking to advertise. Things have changed. Fast forward to the 21st century, and almost everyone on Earth has a video camera in their pocket. With that leap in technology, it came a huge opportunity for individuals to get their share of the advertising dollars. But only if they could build a big enough audience. So this was originally made possible by platforms like YouTube, who essentially pioneered the video sharing and streaming industry. Although we've already seen YouTubers like PewDiePie, Logan Paul, and Mr. Beast become the Walt Disney's of modern mass media, there's still a massive opportunity with the introduction of new apps. That is where TikTok comes in. TikTok's introduction to North America came in about 2017, but absolutely blew up in 2020 with the pandemic. With millions of people stuck at home looking for a creative outlet and thousands of brands looking for a way to spend advertising dollars without being able to hire a video production team, that sucked for us. It was a perfect environment for content creators to be born. With nothing to do but consume or create, billions of hours were spent on this platform, skyrocketing the creator economy into never-before-seen territory. Now, we're still at the beginning of this surge, and the demand for new content is growing larger every single day. So here's your opportunity to become Disney, or at the very least, get paid to do what you love. Now, I get it. This probably still seems very optimistic, and I definitely would not blame you for having doubts, which is exactly why I tested this theory on a brand new channel and was able to get a couple thousand dollars in brand deals after just one month. The best part? They wanted to pay me to play golf, and I'm not even a good golfer. Here are three emails with dates for proof. Now, if you're not ready to run through the damn wall and start making content yet, I'll end this lesson with another case study. This time, it's on my business partner, Meg. She's an entrepreneur at heart, but she's also a new mom. That is a crazy balance. So she wanted to find a way to merge those two lifestyles. Meg created a TikTok a few months ago, and it's regularly getting tens of millions of views weekly, and brands are asking to pay her for videos that she's already posted of her enjoying life with her family. You could literally get paid to do anything. Fishing, sewing, riding a bike, snowboarding, going for a walk. Dog stuff. I don't know what that means, but you could get paid for it. So what does an actual roadmap to achieving this look like? How do you go from dipping your toes in the creator pool to making content creation your full time gig? Attached in this lesson description is a high level step by step guide, which you'll have all of the tools and knowledge to complete by the end of this course. I want you to take a look at that now and start filling out what you can. Now, I've showed you that you can literally get paid to enjoy your lifestyle if you can learn to create content. So I think we better get on with it and get you living your dream life. You ready? Let's go!
