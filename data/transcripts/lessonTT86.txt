 In this lesson, I'm going to be sharing our workflow for editing courses inside of DaVinci Resolve. Now, if you've watched any of our video editing tutorials before, we're going to be using all the same keyboard shortcuts, but with a new workflow. And if you haven't taken any, don't worry, I'm going to start at the beginning and explain everything. So let's dive right in. Now, the very first thing you're going to want to do is download DaVinci Resolve. I've left a link in the lesson description so you can go to the website and you're going to scroll down to it, it says free download now. The ones on the left are a free download, the ones on the right, where it says DaVinci Resolve Studio is a one-time paid version. The paid version is more for things like if you want to add captions, if you want to be using AI features, but everything that you need for this is going to be in the free version. So download that now. Once you have that downloaded onto your computer, we're going to open it up. Now, when it opens, you're going to get this screen here, double click on untitled project. I'm going to name my course editing and hit create. If you're new to DaVinci, don't get overwhelmed. I'm going to make this super simple. You're going to want to go to the tab at the bottom that says edit here. This is where we're going to be doing most of the work for this video. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to go up to where it says DaVinci Resolve in the top left. We're going to click on keyboard customization. You're going to click on the three dots at the top right and go import preset. In the download section for this lesson, there's a TXT file that you can download and then upload here. Now, I've already done that, but once you have that uploaded, just hit save. Now, your keyboard shortcuts are loaded in so you can follow along. The very first thing that we're going to do is we're going to load in all of the footage that we're going to use for our course. For this example, I have my example footage here, so I'm just going to take that and I'm going to drag it into this top left part of DaVinci Resolve. It's going to say change project frame rate. You can hit change. Now, if you double-click on that, you can see we've got our clip. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take that and I'm just going to drag it right down into this bottom window. This is called the timeline and down here, you're going to have your entire raw clip ready to go. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to take this slider here and we're going to zoom right in and we're going to pull this down like this so that we can see the waveform nice and big. When you hit the spacebar, it's going to play through the timeline. So I'm going to show you what that looks like. So what we're going to do is we're going to watch through this clip and we're going to wait for a moment that we want to cut out. I'll show you what I mean. So we're going to hit play. So you saw there's a little section there that we wanted to cut out. So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the end of the wave form for what we want to keep and we're going to hit W on our keyboard. What that's going to do is it's going to create a cut in your timeline right here and now we're going to play again. This section here is what we want to cut out. So what we're going to do is we're going to hit Q. Now when we hit Q, it deleted everything behind the playhead to that break that we made in the clip. So I'll show you one more time. I'm going to go command Z, command Z so you can see. So right after this section here, W and then when we get to the end of the bit that we want to delete, Q. Now that's it. Okay, so let's play that back and see how it feels. As for in the process, there is going to be absolutely no flop. So if you love flop, you're in the wrong place. We did it all. So as you can see, there's a little pause there. So we're going to do the exact same thing one more time. At the end of this clip, we're going to hit W and then we're going to go to the beginning of the next section and we're going to hit Q and that's going to delete everything from the playhead back to where we split the clip. So step one is going to be going through this clip and just doing the W and Q method through the entire thing. It's going to be pretty tedious, but there's really no better way to do this. There are AI tools that are getting close to being able to do it automatically, but I found that it's actually a bit more of a pain in the ass than it's worth and you're not going to end up getting all of the best takes. So I'm just going to speed this up and rip through this clip and then we'll get on to the next step. Another thing that you can do in this process is if there's any long breaths, you can just cut them out using the same thing. So here's an example. There's just a little bit of a gap between those two sentences. So looking at the wave form here, at the end of this line, we can hit W and right before the next line starts, we can hit Q. It's a really minor difference, but if you're doing this hundreds or even thousands of times through your course, it does make it feel a lot more engaging, just cutting out those breaths. I'm going to show you another trick that you can do while going through this process. The make has a line where she delivers it once. She's not quite happy with it, so she delivers it again. I'm going to show you what that looks like. Because we're going to be showing you how we set everything up on the back end. Because we're going to be showing you how we set everything up on the back end. So I like the second take better than the first. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a cut right before the beginning of the second take there. Now I'm going to go right before the first take and I'm just going to hit E. So what E does is it deletes everything after the playhead to the cut in the clip. So just like Q deletes everything before the cut in the clip, E deletes everything after the cut in the clip. Hopefully that makes sense, but once you spend a little bit of time in here, it's going to feel like second nature. So once you get through that, you have a good rough cut of your lesson. And this is going to be about the length that the lesson is going to end up being. But one thing you'll notice is every time you have a cut, it's going to feel a little bit jarring because of the way that the person on camera moves. So what we're going to do is we're going to take every second clip and we're going to zoom it in just a little bit. And that way when you're going from one clip to the next, it doesn't feel quite so jarring. So what we're doing here is we're getting rid of something called a jump cut. So I just want you to go through and every second clip, just zoom it in a little bit. And if you need to on those clips, you can also change the position just by dragging this up or down to make sure that the person is right where you want them. Usually I'd like to keep people center framed for courses. Once you're done that, the bones of your lesson are all done and you could export that and people would probably be totally happy. But I'm going to show you how to take it to the next level using graphics and titles. Adding titles inside DaVinci is super, super easy. All you're going to do is you're going to come over to the left side where it says titles and you're going to find one that you like. If you drag over it from left to right, you can kind of see what it's going to look like. Depending on your style, you can do something flashy, but I like to keep this super clean with something like the center reveal. So you're going to take that and you're just going to drag it on top of your clip. Now, as you can see when you hit play, you're going to get that sample text coming in. So we're going to click on it and we're going to change it to testing a title. Then we're going to change it to whatever font you want. Usually I like to do a Monceric Black Italic. Then we're going to come over onto the left side. We're going to hit open FX and we're going to search for drop shadow. So that's going to come up right here. And we're going to take that and we're going to drag it on top of this. So you can see that adds a big shadow underneath. We're going to increase the shadow strength, lower the distance and lower the blur. So this is just going to make it a little bit easier for people to read your title, especially if you're on a brighter background. So we're going to see what that looks like. You'll wear a hundred thousand new customers. Okay, that looks awesome. And then you can take this end and just drag it to where you want this to play until easy. Now, so you don't have to add that drop shadow and change the font every single time. What you can do is you can click on that title. If you're on a Mac, hold down on option. If you're on a PC, hold down on alt and just take that hold on to it and just drag it over. And what that's going to do is it's going to duplicate that exact same thing over here. And then we can just hit the video tab and change the title to whatever we want. And just like that, we can sprinkle titles throughout to add a little extra emphasis and keep people engaged. Now, here's what to do if you want to add a graphic. I'm going to go into my sample footage. I'm going to grab a sample graphic and I'm just going to drag it right above the timeline over here. I'm going to take it. I'm going to make it the size that I want. Now, this is awesome for any time you want to show something visually that you're talking about. Anything from logos to screenshots of your website. So what we're going to do is we're going to take that and we're going to position it wherever we want it. Let's just say we want it right there. And now you can do the same thing with the drop shadow where you take it and you drag it on top. Remember, increase the strength, lower the distance and then lower the blur. That looks great. You can see what that looks with and without just adds a little bit more depth. And if you want this to fade in nicely rather than a hard cut, what you can do is right click on this left side where this comes out and just go add 12 frames. Do the same thing on the other side when this icon comes up. Just right click. Go add 12 frames. Now it's going to do a nice fade in. Payment processing way better. You can adjust this to the length that you want it to be perfect. And it's the exact same process if you want to add a video that you're referencing. So I'll show you if I drag in a sample B rule. I can just drag it right above the timeline, bring it where I want, resize it. Usually if I do something like this, I would take the footage of the person talking and just zoom right in and just position them on the side. If you want the audio from the clip, perfect. If not, what you can do is hold option on Mac or alt if you're on a PC and click on the audio file and what that's going to do is it's going to allow you to click on the audio file without also selecting the video at the same time and then you can just hit delete and it'll just get rid of that. So we can see what that looks like. So if you haven't already, go sign up for it now with it. That's what that looks like. And remember if you want to get rid of the end of this, what we're going to do is we're going to select it and we're going to hit W. Remember W makes a cut in the clip. We're just going to select the side that we don't want and we're going to hit delete and get rid of it. So now we have this and it goes away as soon as we want it to. Now one more pro tip when you start getting really fast at doing the things that I just showed you is when you're playing through this, what you can do is you can hit three while the video clip is playing and it's going to play at double the speed. So once you really start firing with all of these shortcuts, you're going to be able to edit this twice as fast because you're going to be watching it at 2x speed. So I'll show you what that looks like. It's a great way to watch the video back after you do your first edit and to make sure that everything flows and you didn't miss anything. But once you get fast, you can also use that as a tool to edit the initial cut. Everything that I just showed you is enough to create your entire course and make it as engaging as possible. But I'm going to show you one more thing in case you want to use screen recordings. So what we're going to do is we're going to hit file and we're going to go new timeline. We're going to call this screen recordings and hit enter. What this does is it creates a new timeline. So this is something you can do if you have 10 lessons. You can have 10 timelines for each one and that's going to show up in the left hand side here. So the one we're just using was timeline one. I just created screen recordings and that's a really easy way to separate all of your lessons. So now I'm going to drag my example footage in here again. But now I'm going to show you how to add the screen recordings and make yourself a bubble in the bottom right corner just like I have been throughout this entire lesson. Now if you're on a Mac, you can hit command shift 5 if you wanted to use screen recording right inside using the Mac software. But you can also use tools like QuickTime. There's also a ton of free ones that you can download but I personally just use the built-in Mac screen recording. So remember that while you're screen recording, you're also going to want to be recording yourself just like I'm doing right now. Usually at the beginning, I like to say I'm starting the screen recording in 3, 2, 1, click and then I can match up the screen recording to the audio from the clip of me just so that everything lines up a little bit better. So let's say you have the clip of yourself talking and you have your screen recording. I'm going to show you how to add yourself as a bubble in the bottom corner of the screen. We're going to find our example screen recording. We're going to drag it in and we're going to drag it on top here. So now I would find the part of the video where I say I'm starting the screen recording in 3, 2, 1, click and I would have the screen recording start at that exact moment. Now we're going to take this and we're going to zoom in a bit just so that it takes up the whole screen and now what we're going to do is we're going to select that bottom clip and again if you're on Mac you're going to hold on to option if you're on PC you're going to hold on to Alt and you're going to select that hold down and just drag it up to the top. So now you have the same clip on the top and the bottom. You can hold option or Alt and select one of these audio clips and delete it because we're not going to need that. Now you're going to select the top clip. Now in the bottom tabs we're going to click on this color palette here. I'm going to go in there and then we're going to hit this circle with the four dots around it. Then we're going to hit this circle here. So you probably just notice that it brought up this circle right here. I'm just going to click on clips at the top gallery just to give myself a little bit more room so that you can see. If you take this red dot here you can hold on to it and drag it in and that's getting rid of something called feathering which is when it's a soft line rather than a hard line. We want this to be a hard line so we're going to get rid of that all together. Then we're going to take this circle on the top right and we're going to drag it all the way up until we have a circle all the way around Meg. Now what we're going to do is on the right hand side here we're going to right click and you're going to select add alpha output. This blue dot just appeared here. We're going to hold on to this blue square and we're going to drag it down to this blue dot. There we go. Now we have our bubble and we're going to go back to the main screen here. Now you're going to take it and you're going to drag it down and put it somewhere where it's not covering any important information. So now we're just going to go through and do the exact same thing that we did before where we're going to hit play. We're going to hit W when we want to make a cut. Keep in mind that if you're only selecting one clip and you hit W it's only going to make a cut in that one clip. If you want to cut through everything in the timeline just make sure that you're not selecting any clips and to do that you can just click anywhere outside of these. So we're going to hit W and that's going to make a cut in everything and then I'm going to zoom in just so I can see a little bit better. We're going to go to the end of the part that we want to cut out and we're going to hit Q. So same thing as before you're just going to go through and do that to the entire thing. Now you might be wondering why do we have a clip that's completely covered. The reason that I have that is because once in a while just like this it's nice to go full screen with your face rather than having the screen recording and the bubble. So what you can do is let's say I just wanted this section here to be full screen. We're going to make it so there's a cut on either side and we're going to select the two clips above and we're going to hit D. What D does is it just disables those clips. So now when we watch through you can see there's bubble make and she goes full screen. Perfect. So once you've gone through and you've taken out everything that you don't want to be in there you've added your graphics, you've added your titles, you've done punch in so that there's no weird jump cuts. You are ready to export. So what you're going to do is you're going to go over to this rocket ship also known as the delivery tab. Usually right off the bat everything is going to be pretty much what you want but if it's not usually I like to export in quick time H264 depending on what you shot in if it was on your phone or the SLR you're going either going to be in 23.976 frames per second or 30 just do whatever is in the timeline. Title it, testing, add your location, documents, add to render queue and render all. And just like that your lesson is ready to upload to Kajabi and start sharing with students. Now before I end this I want to share one more thing that you might be wondering about and that's how to make your video look a little bit better with color. So what we're going to do is we're going to go to this color tab right here. I've already got this to a point where I'm happy with it but I'm going to show you what you can tweak if you want to take it a little bit further. So on the right hand side this is called a node and this is where all of your color changes are going to live. So what we're going to do is we're going to come over to this circle with the dot in the middle. I'm going to click on this circle with the dot in the middle over here and these are the color wheels. So if you want to make everything a bit brighter you just take this slider on the bottom and you can drag it right or left. If you want to add to the highlights bring this one up. If you want to boost the midtones bring this one up and same with the lift at the bottom. I'm going to hit this one up here to just reset everything that I did. With all of our exports I like to add a bit of saturation which is this one right here you can just hold down on it and drag to the right. I finally usually you lose five to ten points of saturation when you export the video so it's nice to add that just to give it a little bit more life. You can do the same thing with the contrast here. You can just add like point zero two just to make it a little bit popier and play around with this try and have fun with it and make it look as good as you can even if you're just using phone footage a lot of the time you can make it look really great just by manipulating these settings. Now once you have it exactly how you like it what we're going to do is we're going to come up and we're going to hit clips in the top here. If you want to apply it to everything else what we're going to do is click on everything that hasn't been colored yet so you can select one and then hold shift and select to the end then right clip on the clip that has been colored and go apply grade. What that's going to do is it's going to take the grade or the colors that you've added to this clip and it's going to apply it to everything else. So just for example I'm just going to do something crazy with this just so you can see how it works so this is my colored clip. I'm going to select on all of these ones select the first one hold shift select the last one and then right click on my clip that's been colored and go apply grade. And it's going to do that across the board. Now it looks terrible but you get the idea. All right there you have it those are the basics for editing a course inside of DaVinci Resolve. I know it can be a little bit tedious it can be a little bit mind numbing but remember it is worth it because you're going to help other people learn all of the amazing things that you know and with that I cannot wait to see your course at it and I will see you in the next one.
