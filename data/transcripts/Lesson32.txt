 Welcome to video editing part two, making it good. Hmmm. Now that I have the main edit done, the next step I want to take is to find the music that I'm going to use. There's two different ways that we typically do this here at one peak. The first is using trendy audio from TikTok and I'm going to show you the easiest way to do that right now. Now what you're going to do is pull out your phone, open the TikTok app, go to create, it's up, add sound, and from here you're just going to scroll through trending audio until you find your favorite song or something that you feel like suits the video well. For the purpose of this video I'm going to go into commercial sounds because this is going to be part of a course that we're selling and I'm going to go to TikTok viral and let's just listen to the first song on here. Okay cool this could work. Kind of cool but feels a little bit slow. Not the vibe. A little bit loud. That could work. So now that you've found a song you like you're going to exit out of it and start screen recording which is something that I'm already doing for the purpose of this course. If it's not easy to locate in your phone's drop-down menu you can just quickly google search how to screen record. All phones will have the option to do it and it's usually really quick to set up. So once you've begun screen recording you'll click on your song and let it play all the way through from front to back so you have the clip and its entirety. From there you'll stop screen recording it'll save to your library then you'll go into your library and air drop that video to your computer or send it as a message whichever way works best for you. Okay so now I've got my screen recording I'm going to drag it into the audio folder of our project. From there I can go back into the project on Premiere and drag in the audio folder to here as well. Then we're good to go. And you can just select where your audio starts find your endpoint and drag it in by selecting the audio only option. Once it's in your timeline you'll be able to see the actual waveform of your audio so you can select the end of the clip and hover over bring that down and choose exactly where your audio starts and drag it to where you want it to start in your timeline. Typically just at the very beginning of the video works best. The other option for getting music for your video would be using a copyright free music library such as SoundStripe which is something we use quite frequently around here so I will quickly show you how to do that as well. Open up Safari, go to SoundStripe, we obviously already have a profile on here so I can just do this. SoundStripe is a pretty affordable music library and you can use their music for pretty much anything that you need. So it's one of our favorite platforms for sourcing copyright free music. From here you can go into playlists is usually the easiest option. Go to music. What's great about this is they create their playlist based on kind of either a genre or just a vibe. So as you can see here, BakeOff, I would imagine that's kind of light bright airy kitchen footage, trick or treat. That might be a little bit more aimed towards kids but have a little bit of that spooky vibe to it. Fall wedding would probably be a little bit more acoustic cinematic, beautiful love songs so they paint a really good picture of what style of music it's going to be based on the playlist name and cover photo. The process here is essentially the same as getting audio from TikTok after this point. You basically just license and download the audio right into your project folder in the audio bin and then you bring that into your premiere project. Let's get back over there. Now that the music's in here, the very first thing you're going to want to do is turn the audio down because right now it's going to be peeking at about zero decibels which is already six decibels louder than your current audio track. So hit G again, negative, 14 is usually a good starting point for me and enter it. They are competing a little bit but it's pretty close and we can refine that as we go. Now that you've leveled your audio, I would also drag it back to make sure that it starts right at the beginning of the video. So removing those first two dead frames, dragging it back and then right clicking and applying default transitions. This will just fade the audio in so it's like a nice smooth transition into the video. Something I'm noticing right now is there's a solid 12-ish frames of dead space before she starts talking. We really want to get rid of that so we can get into the meat of the video right off the bat. So these are all little things that you'll pick up on as you're editing through your videos. Some of the important to note here is we're going to start making edits on our main video and audio but we don't necessarily want to make edits on the music layer. So how do we avoid doing that? All you have to do is lock that layer with this little padlock to the left here. Now you can edit this as much as you want and nothing on the music layer will change it all. So let's start by finding the point where she starts talking right about here and then we can use that cue button again to bring it right up to the front. That feels a lot better. A lot of the time the next step would be cutting the video so it's on beat with the music but in this particular instance keeping all of the dialogue tight in the video is more important so we're not going to be as worried about cutting the video on beats. Now that the audio is smoothly in there we're going to play the video all the way through and make sure there's not any points where the music and dialogue are competing and that everything flows smoothly and makes sense. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here never look quiet if you go to see it. What the f***? So we're vowing to change that. Wow you're going to start making real quality food? No that would be expensive. We're going to start taking f*** photos. Can you make it look worse? Fast food. It took 30 seconds. What do you expect? Okay so from that what I noticed is there's a couple areas where our main character's dialogue gets a little bit lost and competes with the music so we're going to go through and adjust that using what's called keyframes. Okay so what are keyframes? In this instance keyframes are going to be used to select different areas of audio within the same track and raise or lower them to different levels. So as you can see in this waveform here the audio at the end of the clip is quite a bit lower than the audio even partway through. We want to make sure that flow is consistently so we keep her audio the entire time. Let's just listen back to this and see how much that audio fades off. Here never look quiet if you go to see it. I pretty much completely lose what she's saying which for TikTok or really for any video is a big no no. We want to make sure we can hear what is being said. So how do we fix that? Using keyframes which is as simple as hitting P for the pen tool on your keyboard. Now what you're going to do is select a point on this here line and just do one click. Let's going to drop a keyframe into your audio. So we haven't actually changed any audio levels yet. We've just put in a keyframe. I'm going to put a second one in over here. So the audio in this section is already very easy to hear. It's loud enough. I don't really want to adjust that at all. But the audio here was quite hard to recognize. So all we have to do in this case is raise this keyframe up from six decibels to let's try something like 12. That way we're adding six decibels on there. It should be a little bit easier to pick up. Still a little bit quiet. So now what we can do is just raise that all the way to the top. So now we've raised that all the way to 15 and we can also taper this back a little bit so it's a bit more of a gradual incline. So making sure this one's still at six decibels and this raises a little bit earlier on. Now it's a little bit easier to hear what she's saying all the way through that clip. So I'll continue doing that through to the rest of the video making sure that we never lose her audio anywhere. The f***. So we're vowing to change that. Wow. You're going to start making real quality food? Nope. That would be expensive. We're going to start taking s*** photos. Can you make it looks worse? That's food. It took 30 seconds. What do you expect? Now that all of the audio is pretty consistent. I did notice there was a couple points where the music felt like it was a little bit louder than the voice. So what we can do there is just turn this down by another four decibels. Another thing that you'll notice is the audio that we used for this isn't long enough for the whole length of the video. So there's a couple ways that we can fix this. Either A, we can go back and select a different soundtrack or B, we can cut and paste sections of this audio on the beat to make sure that it lasts the full length of the video. I'm going to show you how to do option B. Adobe Premiere has actually made this really simple. All you have to do is right click on your audio, go to remix, enable remix, and then from there in your essential sound you'll see remix properties. So the length of our video is a little bit less than 30 seconds and so we need our audio to be at least that long. So in here from target duration we'll change that from 2406 to 30 seconds and head enter. So as you can see Premiere has automatically cut and pasted audio back in on beat. So let's listen to that and see how it sounds. You're going to start making real quality food? No, that would be excellent. So as you can see the audio extends past the video. For a TikTok because it loops it doesn't really matter so we'll just drag that back and cut it at the end of the video. Now that we have our music in with our video and audio it's time to make things a little bit more interesting. One super important thing especially on TikTok and reels is your pacing. You want to have a cut in your video anytime there's a lull or it feels like it's been hanging on your subject for too long. Because this is a very fast paced video I'm probably going to put a cut about every second maybe a little bit more frequently than that. Here's how that'll look. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here never look quite as good as we have. This section of the video is going to have a title at the beginning which keeps people's interest so I don't really feel like there's any need to have an additional cut here which brings us to about the five second point in the video. What? Look for this section I really want to put emphasis on my character's line because it has such impact and in order to do that I'm going to use what's called a punch in which we can just do here and edit in. To do that I'm going to find the exact line that I want to put emphasis on. In this case it's f***. So we'll go to where that word is right here. Select C which is our cut tool and then option and click on our video layer. That cuts this layer of video in half and essentially creates two separate videos. Now I'll go back and hit A for my cursor. Select that video, go into Effect Controls and I'm going to punch in to let's just say 150% for emphasis. Enter. As you can see I'm a lot larger in the frame now. Now let's watch that back and see how it feels. What the f***. I feel like I didn't quite nail where I wanted that emphasis to be. As you can see there's a little bit of a pause after what. So to me it feels more like that emphasis should be moved up to that. That's super easy to do. Now that we have two separate clips we can just option and drag this up and option drag this out to match. What the f***. That feels better. It emphasizes on the point that I want to emphasize. To me it still feels like we need another cut in here and I don't want to cut this main shot again so I'm going to go back through our footage and see if there's any more additional b-roll because I think there was a b-roll shot that we captured to put in here just in case. Perfect. There it is. So same rule as we used before. Checking where my hand is. I'm just starting to grab the burger and look at it so we can cut in right here. And that's about all I need for there. Let's see how that flows through now. So that feels like it's coming in a little bit late and I think I can just slide this out a little bit longer and show a little bit more of grabbing the actual burger. Repositioning it again and let's see how that flows. What the f***. So we're back. Now that drags a little bit further over the next clip than I'd like it to so I can just bring that back a little bit. This is another opportunity I feel like to add an impactful cut on the sound of her closing the box. I don't really think that we need this additional little bit at the end. It feels like a little bit of a lull. So what I'm going to do is just drag this back to the moment that box gets slammed and make sure I keep that audio in there. Then I can once again lock that audio layer to make sure it doesn't move and then select this space and just hit D which will drag everything back. Okay let's play that through again. Wow you're gonna start making real wallety food. Okay that cut feels really good but this next scene feels like it drags on a little bit long again. So we're gonna use the exact same method that we used earlier to cut in and add emphasis to points. This is what that'll look like. I want to cut in on real. So now I'm going to select my blade tool using C. Find the point that I want to cut. Hold option so I'm just cutting the video layer. Real. I want to cut on real and I want to cut on quality. Quality food. And you know what? I think I'm gonna cut on food as well. Okay. Let's really drive this point home. So now I just want to get incrementally closer. So it's not as dramatic of 100% to 150% but we're gonna gradually punch closer and closer with each point. So from 100 let's go to 125. We'll be position that a little bit. You're making real. And then we can go from there to 150. Quality. And then from there we can go to 175. And so this method will just deliver the point a little bit better and keep the attention going because the scenes appear to at least change slightly. So let's watch that through. Oh, you're gonna start making real quality food. Nope. That would be expensive. We're gonna start. Great. That feels really good. So now transition in into the next scene. Nope. That would be expensive. I feel like that first line on its own feels great. But dragging that same scene on for a bit feels like it could get a little bit too long and we might start losing people. So as soon as we have that low or that pause, I'm gonna cut in a little bit tighter for her next point which is kind of the joke of this line. And we'll land a little bit better with some emphasis on it. So once again, selecting C, using option and cutting just that one section. Now I want to do that right as she starts talking. So I'll actually drag that down a little bit closer to there using option and just selecting this video layer again. And then we'll punch in to emphasize on that. So let's go to 150 again. Position her in the center. Nope. That would be expensive. We're gonna start taking Can you make it look worse? Same thing with this. I think there's a little bit of a long pause. But I think with this pause, what we have the opportunity to do is something called a power zoom. You might recognize this editing style from shows like the office. They did a really good job of that. How they did that was in camera with a zoom lens. So from a wide, they would zoom into a tight. But you can get that same effect within your editing software. And I'm going to show you how to do that. Okay, so with this selected, we're going to use keyframes again. Although this time, they're not going to be for the audio. They're going to be for the video. When you go into your effect controls, you'll see over here, there's these little stopwatch looking figures. Those are the buttons you're going to use to select your keyframes. In this instance, we want to use both position and scale. Because we're going to be zooming in and we're going to be repositioning her within the screen. We're zoomed out now. Let's start by tossing in our first keyframes, which is just going to be our standard wide shot. Now, this is the line that we want impact on. So this is when we should be punched in. Now that we have our two keyframes here, these are where we'll make our second keyframes or our last keyframes. And let's see what it looks like at 150%. A little bit more focused just on Meg. Let's see how that feels. Can you make it work? Where's she? Nice. As she has her paws, the camera's zooming in. It feels like we're kind of thinking with her something's still happening and then she delivers her line by the time we're all the way zoomed in. I like the way that this feels. If you did want to make that zoom a little bit faster, which oftentimes you will, it's as easy as moving these keyframes. So our intro keyframes can be the same, which you can navigate to just by clicking this go to next keyframe. And then what we would do is we'd move our second or ending keyframes either further back to be a longer zoom or closer up to be a faster zoom. So I'm going to select these two keyframes and move it about half the distance. So now you'll see this zoom happens quite a bit faster. Work. Work. It's a little bit too fast for me. So I'm just going to revert to the previous edit, which you can do by hitting command Z. That's just going to redo any mistake or edit that you made. Great. Gonna unlock this because we made changes. It's not fully aligned anymore. Okay. Now we have a video with audio. We have a couple of zooms and punches for accents and impact. It's really starting to feel like this video is coming together. In this stage of the edit, you're going to watch it back multiple times and continue adding points where things feel like they're a little bit dull or could use more emphasis. For me, after this photo shoot scene, I think that we could use some imagery that we got from that day to show the different images of the fast food that we captured for the billboard. So I'm going to take those photos, bring them into here and use that as a design element for this video. Let's do it. So I'll start by going back to my project folder and then I'm going to create a new folder and call this photos and then go and select some of those images from the shoot. Put them in the folder and bring that into the project. So now we want to bring these in and make it look like they're photos that are being taken on set. How do we do that? Let's find out. So right as she finishes that line and looks back to the photographer, I think that's where we can start adding in quick photos. So let's do a couple. That looks disgusting. So as you can see, that size obviously isn't formatted properly because this specifically is a screenshot. So we want to start by making sure that that all fits properly. That looks good there. Add in our next one and in out points. Obviously there's no audio on these. We just need that much of it. Okay, so I'm going to layer all three of these clips on top of one another. But I want to make sure that they all look different. So here's my top clip. I'm going to start by positioning it. We'll make this a real macro shot. So we get a lot of the texture of that greasy burger. That looks like something. So there's the first image we use. And then I want to be able to check the images underneath it as well. As you can see, I've just stacked all three on top of each other for now. So in order to look at what's underneath this, with this clip selected, I can just hit V, and that will enable or disable the clip. So it keeps in the timeline without deleting it, but now it's just not visible anymore. Okay, so now I can toggle that on and off. Is there enough of a difference there? I think so. But maybe I can just move this around a little bit more. So it's a bit more dead space, more focused on the fries. Now there's a dramatic difference in the two. I feel like this is a little bit too much dead space. You can't really see what's in frame. So what I'm going to do there is bring this back over a little bit like that. That's a bit of a wider shot. You still have the macro here. There's enough of a difference between those two. So now I'm going to toggle this second layer off and look at the last shot. This one's more center framed. I think to differentiate a little bit more, I'm just going to slide him over to the left. Something like that just so it really feels like there's three different photos. That feels really good to me. Because these two are so similar, I think what I want to do is put this bottom one in between the two of them. So here's what I'm going to do next. Make sure all of those are on. This bottom layers in the middle. And now we want to stagger these three clips out. So it looks like they're appearing in sequential order. So let's go one, two, three frames. That might be a little bit tight. I'm going to go four. And then now we'll count another one, two, three, four frames. And then that's when we'll want the next photo to appear. So now they'll all appear in frame sequentially really quickly. One, two, three. And that's enough time to kind of showcase our point with the photos. We'll just close those off there. Click, click, click. Perfect. Now as I was doing this, I realized that there was some dead space on this one. So I'm going to have to scale it up a bit. Let's go 125. That fills everything up nicely. Okay. So that feels kind of cool. But I don't think you can really tell that we're taking photos. So in order to do that, let's add some sound effects. Here at One Peak, we use a software called Soundly, which is essentially a library of sound effects that you can drag and drop into your video in real time. So for this case, all I would do is go to the search bar and search camera. See what kind of sounds there are. None of those really sound like a camera. So we'll just keep going. That sounds like a camera to me. All we do here is select the amount of clip that we want and drag it right into our timeline. It's a really awesome software that makes editing sound very, very seamless. And I would highly recommend using it. We've got a link in the description if you want to check it out. Now Soundly is a paid subscription. But if you want a free alternative, you can use a website called freesound.org. Okay, so now that I've got that audio layer in, I want to align it with the very start of when the shutter would actually click, which is the start of the photo. We'll make this track a little bit bigger. We'll see where the shutter clicks, and now it's in line with the camera. Okay, so let's see how this feels. Cool. Sounds like a camera taking a photo. It could probably be a little bit louder because it gets lost a little bit in the music. So let's just add five decibels onto that. And now we want to make sure that there's a shutter click for each photo that's being taken. So what you can do here is hold down option, select your clip, and then just drag it down. And it makes an automatic duplicate. Then you'll take that and drag it perfectly in line with the next layer. Let's listen to that. Sounds like two photos being taken. Do that one more time, option, drag down into a new layer of audio, and align it with the last clip. So now it should sound like a camera shutter clicking three times. Perfect. Now that sound, along with the photos, gives you the idea that you're in the studio, getting those images of the food before converting it into a billboard. Now I'm going to watch through again and see how this feels. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here never look quite as good as the ads. What the f***? So we're vowing to change that. Wow, you're going to start making real quality food. Nope, that would be expensive. We're going to start taking f***ing photos. Can you make it look worse? Fast food. It took 30 seconds. What do you expect? This is feeling really good. Usually one of the final things that we take a look at is the color of the video. We already edited the color of this footage in a separate program just to make things easier. But if you were just taking this straight out of your phone, I'm going to show how you would correct it to make sure everything looks perfect. Let's start with this first clip. You're going to go over to your Lumetri color window. As I said before, I'm really happy with that. The color looked on this, but let's say we thought it was a little bit too cold. From here, we can just go into our color correction and add either warm or cool tones. As you can see, it changes pretty drastically. If you're finding the color balance to be a little bit off, what you can do as a quick hack is take this eyedropper tool and select something white from your frame. She was wearing a white shirt that day, so that works pretty well. As you can see, it automatically drags the temperature up quite a bit and also adds a little bit more greens to the tent. For me, I don't think this looks the way I want it to, so I'm just going to revert that at it by using Command Z. The other things you can adjust in here are your overall brightness by using exposure, as you can see, pretty drastic difference. The contrast, which is kind of the difference between the light and dark areas in your image, as you can see here, your highlights, which is going to be mainly this area in the sky, your shadows, which are going to be these areas around here, increased and decreased, your whites, which will also mainly be up here, essentially anything that's really white, this will add or subtract, and your blocks, which is the opposite. The black areas in your clip, which will make them much darker or wash them out of it. That's essentially everything that you'll really need to use. One additional area you might be interested in is opening up this creative and adding some saturation, just to make your clip a little bit more vibrant than what else you might see on TikTok, or potentially even adding some sharpness and vibrance, but I wouldn't take these much past 10. And that is some very basic color, but it'll be enough to allow you to edit and get a specific look from your video, and at least make sure everything is balanced and even. One final thing with color is if you wanted to adjust everything at once and give it a specific look, well let's say maybe your entire video is too dark. You can do everything at once with an adjustment layer. So I'm going to start by going to the project bin and moving this over a little bit until you can see this little paper looking icon. You're going to select new item, go down to adjustment layer, make sure the settings are the same, they automatically will be, press OK, and then you can drag that down into your video. So for this I want to make sure that it's over everything in the video, and these three photo layers go all the way up to the fifth track, so that means this needs to be on track number six. This is a really good tip for adding any kind of specific filters or maybe some kind of vignette or making sure that everything looks consistent through. OK, let's get rid of that. Now your video has all of the layers and all of the elements it needs to make that perfect piece of social content. So you're ready to export. Now what you want to export will be the video as it is in the timeline, but currently we don't have any outpoint. So if you were to export this now, it would give you a final video with black space at the end. In order to make sure we don't do that, we add an outpoint. So what I do is go to the very last frame of the video and then toggle over one frame, hit O. That will bring your outpoint perfectly to the very end of the video. From here, you can just move over to this export tab, title your video, we're going to call it fast food, select quality. So we typically go map source, adaptive high bit rate. This is the best setting for exporting to social media to make sure none of the quality is lost and it's also not too large of a file. From there, you'll also want to select the location. It should automatically go to your project folder because that's where everything's been created. Save and then from there, all you have to do is hit export. Boom! You're done. The video is exported. Let's double check and make sure it's in our folder. There it is. Good to go. All right, there you have it, an edited video. Great work getting through these last couple of lessons. I know that this is a ton of information and if you're new to this, it can be pretty overwhelming at times. So I hope this was easy enough to understand and I hope you feel confident and ready to continue editing your next videos. But before we get into editing your next videos, it's time to release this one. Congratulations, you just finished the creation module. I hope you had so much fun and I hope you're ready to release what you just created into the world because that is exactly what we're about to do in the next module. I cannot wait to see you over there.
