 In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to create a winning offer that will engage your customer and convince them you have something worth buying within five seconds of arriving on your landing page. Every business is selling the solution to a problem. The bigger the problem, the bigger the business can be, and you should be able to describe your solution in just one sentence. For example, here are a couple of solutions to problems from some of the world's largest and most interesting brands. For Amazon, two-day shipping on anything you can imagine is a $912 billion per year solution for Lulu Lemon, making stylish, high-performance athletic wear for everyday life is a $9 billion per year solution. And for Squatty-Potty, helping people poop more efficiently is a $30 million per year solution. For us, teaching the fastest way to get a million views on social media is a $10 million per year solution. You should be able to clearly communicate your solution in five to fifteen words. And the more enticing that one-liner is, the stronger your offer will be. If you don't already have that, I want you to pause the video and write down what problem your product or service solves. Once you have that written down, let's get into the seven core elements I believe you need to consider when you create your offer. If you haven't read $100 million offers by Alex Hormozzi, put it on your reading list because he dives deep into all of these and is a master at offer creation. I put a link to the book in the lesson description. The seven elements are outcome, price, time required, effort required, perceived likelihood of success, associated risk, and reason for urgency. I'm going to give you an analogy to explain all of this. Imagine you've been walking through the desert for days without food or water when you arrive at the beach. Over the ocean, in the distance, you see an oasis of fresh fruit and clean flowing water. On the shore, you see three people. The first is selling water wings. The second is renting out his sailboat and the third is ferrying people over in a speedboat. The outcome for all three is the same, reaching the oasis. Price. The water wings are cheap. The sailboat is expensive and the speedboat is right in the middle. Time. Water wings will take all day. The sailboat will take all morning and the speedboat will take about an hour. Effort. The water wings will take swimming over. The sailboat will take learning how to sail and the speedboat will just be sitting on your ass. Perceived likelihood of success. If there are sharks in the ocean, you might not get there at all with the water wings. And if you can't figure out how to sail, you might blow in the wrong direction with the sailboat. But there's no reason the speedboat won't get you there. So far, the speedboat is looking like a clear winner. But here's how it becomes an offer so good you'd feel stupid saying no. Eliminate the risk. If you're not happy with the service at the end of your trip, you can have your money back. You can only add urgency. But it only takes one person every day and a few people are walking up the beach behind you. Suddenly, you not only have a clear winner, but you have a reason to get on board right now. Your goal is to create a speedboat offer, something that makes your solution look as obvious as the speedboat does in this scenario. You also need to make sure you're selling to the right audience. If those three options were on a beach filled with kids playing, the water wings would win every time. And if those three were in front of a Bachelorette party, the sailboat could crush. You might have a slam dunk offer, but your business will fail if you're trying to get in front of the wrong person. These seven elements can live throughout all of your marketing material. And they should. Here's what that is looked like for us. Outcome. Millions of views. Price. $97. Time. Two hours to complete the course. Effort. A few videos a week. Perceived likelihood of success. Look at all these case studies like Jerry who had never made a video and got 300,000 followers after taking our course. Risk. If you don't love it, we'll give you your money back. No questions asked. Urgency. It's on sale today for 40% off. Now if you're selling a candle, it could look like this. Outcome. A better smelling house. Price. $20. Time. Shipped in two days. Effort. Ten seconds to light it. Perceived likelihood of success. Look at all these happy customers. Risk. If your house doesn't instantly smell better, get a refund. Urgency. If you buy now, you'll get another one for free. No matter what you sell, understanding these seven elements of a slam dunk home run offer is going to help you make your product a no brainer for people who get to your landing page. We dive so much deeper into all of these things in our video ad academy.
