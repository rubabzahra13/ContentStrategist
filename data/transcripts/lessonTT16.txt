 One of the questions that we get asked daily is how to create content that gets millions of views without having to show your face. While we've always gotten in front of the lens for our accounts, we've had students take the course and use what they learn to have viral success with faceless content. So in this lesson, I'm going to break down how to apply everything that you've learned throughout this course to videos without ever having to show your face. First, let's talk about the reasons you may want to avoid showing your face. If you're representing several brands at once and don't want your face associated with each one, or there's a conflict of interest holding you back from showing your face on social media, that's a great time to go faceless. There are also some niches like cooking or product reviews that can be equally effective without showing your face. I'll talk more about that later. But if the reason for going faceless is because your camera shy, I want you to challenge yourself to slowly become more confident with the idea of getting in front of the camera. Because faceless content does come with some disadvantages. Faces are one of the most engaging things psychologically to look at. When you see a face, your brain is subconsciously doing countless tiny observations, trying to unpack details about them, like their emotions, their intentions, their age, race, which TV character they remind you of. I want you to imagine watching a faceless movie. How engaging would the visuals have to be for you not to walk out of the theater? Being able to use a face to communicate, show emotion, and build connection is one of the easiest ways to keep people's attention. So if you're creating faceless content, you'll need to work twice as hard to create visuals that are equally or more engaging than showing your face. But don't get discouraged because in this video, I'm going to show you exactly how that's possible and how you can get started today. One big reason that faceless content can be more challenging is because of the lowest hanging fruit principle. The vast majority of people are going to do whatever is easiest and take the path of least resistance. For example, over the past five years, you probably noticed an absolute flood of people who create six second videos using a clip that they already have in their camera roll and a text block, saying something like, want three secrets to be healthier, read the caption. No offense to anybody who does that, but because it's so easy, hundreds of thousands of people post those videos every day. And one note of every hundred thousand will actually go viral. That's probably an exaggeration, but you get my point. Here's where it gets interesting. That viral anomaly is the one that you're going to see, which will probably make you feel like that's what's working right now on social media. And better yet, it's the easiest thing that you could possibly do. Now I'm not saying that you can't be successful with that type of content. You just need to work harder to make the videos different from all the others being posted. Your number one priority, if you want to be successful as a creator, especially with faceless content is to stand out, which means that rather than trying to think of the easiest thing to post, you should be thinking about the most valuable or the most engaging thing to post. So let's talk about the lowest hanging fruit principle for faceless content creation. This will include things like stock video, movie clips, or AI generated photos. You may have heard people talk about creating dozens of faceless posts in an hour using AI. A key to grow with faceless content is separating yourself from all of that noise. And I'm about to walk through all the ways that you're going to do it. Number one, just like we teach throughout the course, the most important thing by an absolute landslide is the hook. If you can't give someone a reason to watch your video in the first five seconds, they've already scrolled. The only difference that comes with faceless content is you need to find visuals that are at least as engaging as talking to the camera. Our student, Aaron, is a perfect example of this with his channel going halves. He created a series where he attempts to cut objects perfectly in half so that both halves weigh the exact same amount. He was able to get over a million views on his first video to the channel and has been crushing ever since. He starts his videos with a visual of sawing an object in half to create curiosity while having a text block and voiceover that gives viewers the context for why they should watch until the end. Even though it's simple, it's incredibly intriguing. Here's another example from a student named Stephanie. She hooks people in by showing and talking about products that are going to add value to the viewer's life. Even though it takes more effort, creating the video yourself will also help your content to be more recognizable when people come across it in the future. When you're scrolling your feed, if you see the face of a content creator you love, you'll stop. Because you already know that you're going to be interested in what they have to say. With faceless content, you want to have a visual style that is as recognizable as somebody's face. Looking again at the going halves example, anytime someone sees an object on this wooden cutting board, they'll know exactly what they're going to get. And if they love the first video, they know they're going to love this one. This can be a background, an object, a visual style, or even the editing and captioning styles. Think of it like a visual signature that you put on your videos in the first five seconds so that people know that they're going to love it the moment they land on it. This also illustrates the importance of having a repeatable format with your faceless content. Another strategy that we teach throughout the course. Since you're going to have to think twice as much about the visuals because you can't show your face, having a repeatable format is going to make the content creation more important. Next, let's talk about how to actually shoot the videos. The easiest way to create faceless content is by shooting in first person, which is from your line of sight. These are usually things that include steps or features. I'll give you some examples. For cooking channels, faces are usually unnecessary because you can show the process of creating a dish step by step from the first person perspective. Unless you have a great reputation like a Gordon Ramsay, people are mostly there to see the food. An example of content with features would be someone showing the features of a new car or a realtor showing the features of a luxury home. These are all things that are equally or more engaging from first person perspective. This also works if you're creating content about products. For example, an Amazon affiliate marketer could easily create a faceless channel by shooting in first person and showing the product being unboxed, examined and used. A lot of the time, that's what people actually want to see over the creator's face anyways. Another important thing to remember with faceless content is cutting the lulls. Because you can't rely on expressions or introducing new characters to keep people engaged, it's so important to keep the pace up with faceless content. Keep giving people something to focus their attention on without getting bored. This might mean making your script more condensed or finding unique ways to illustrate what you're talking about with visuals. Now I want to talk about one major benefit of faceless content and being able to rely more on visuals to tell your story. The channel, RatchetPotes, I don't know if that's how you say it, was able to get 297 million views on its first video ever. You heard right 297 million on a channel that had never posted anything, zero followers. And the crazy thing is, it would have been impossible to get those numbers if it wasn't faceless. Let me explain. Visuals have the power to cross language borders and make content accessible to anybody globally. As soon as you put someone in front of the camera speaking English, you're excluding roughly 87% of the global population. Obviously there are very few types of content that can be created without adding any language. But satisfying visuals are able to captivate people who might not have realized that they were interested in the actual message that you were sharing. Do not underestimate the power of satisfying visuals. One more thing that I need to mention when it comes to faceless content is the rise of AI generated influencers, influencers that are completely computer generated. We keep seeing more and more tools for content creation that allow you to provide a script or even just a prompt and have AI create the person delivering the script to a camera that's almost indistinguishable from real life. If you go this route, pretty much everything from this course applies 100%. Because it's technically no longer faceless content. The AI tools available are evolving daily. So we'll put a list in the description that you can check out and dive further into if you're interested. In my opinion, there's nothing right now that does a good enough job of matching the tone and emotional quality of real life to be worth thiving into. But I do know that that's not going to be the case for long and very soon there are going to be AI content creators that are just as or more successful than the real deal. Those are the best ways to apply everything that you've learned from this course to faceless content. It's important to be just as intentional with faceless content as you would be with anything else. Often it can feel like a faster, easier, and more accessible way to gain traction on social media. And while that's definitely possible, it still requires the groundwork to come up with great ideas that are worth watching. If you're having troubles thinking of those ideas, you can find the link below to Peakbot, which is our AI content creation brainstorming tool. If you're not sure what that is, essentially you answer a few questions about yourself and it's going to give you a list of hooks that you can use for your content. In it, you can also mention that you're creating faceless content so that all of the ideas apply exactly to what you're doing. Alright, that is how to crash faceless content and until next time, I look forward to seeing what you create.
