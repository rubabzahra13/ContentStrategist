 Welcome to the first module of this course, Creative Mindset. We are so happy that you're here and ready to take your content creation to the next level. Before we can dive into the juicy stuff like filming tips and storytelling, it's important to first understand the value of a positive creative mindset. If you're already working as a content creator, you might not think that you need to work through the section of the course, but please, if you're considering skipping this module, you need to understand that this will be the foundation on which you build an incredible long lasting career in this field. You can build a beautiful home with no foundation, but when a storm comes and chances are it will, that house is going to topple. We truly believe that a positive creative mindset is what is going to set you apart from other creators, and here at One Peak we attribute all of our success to the lessons laid out in this module. The fact of the matter is anyone can learn how to tell a good story, but only a select for you have the drive, dedication, and patience to put in this important groundwork and make it a part of their identity. If you can master your creative mindset, I promise it will be your biggest secret weapon. It will open doors to unimaginable possibilities and bring you so much closer to your wildest dreams. If you can adopt the practices of the power of belief, goal setting, and habits which are laid out in this module, you're going to be a more confident creator, learn how to dream bigger, and develop habits to make those dreams a reality.
