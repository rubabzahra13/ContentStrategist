 Now that you have your story in hand, chances are you may have to pitch it to either a client or other members of your creative team before you can dive into production. But even if that isn't the case for you at this point, I still suggest working through this lesson so you can understand all that goes into pitching and some of our tips for success. Okay, let's chat pitching. I love pitching. At this stage, you have an incredible idea planned out and now it's time to rally people to get behind it. And for a lot of people, the whole idea of selling or pitching can feel downright icky. So in this lesson, I'm going to flip the switch so you can start viewing pitching as a positive rather than a chore. The first three tips are going to help shift your pitching mindset. I'll help you swap your fears for confidence and give you the tools to establish a strong pitching relationship and share some tips to create a positive environment for everyone. Then the final tip, tip number four, I'm going to walk you through the exact outline that we use here at One Peak to pitch our creative concepts to make the more digestible for others. Sound like fun? Let's do it. The three tens rule. When you hear the word pitch or sales, how do they make you feel? For many people, these words trigger the feeling of fear. Fear of not being liked, fear of not being good enough, being perceived as pushy, or the fear of rejection. But to sum all of that up, it really comes down to the fear of judgment. And I personally think that this stems from the old school salesman stereotype of people who are aggressive, intimidating, and dishonest. We assume that whoever we are trying to pitch automatically puts us into that category. So how do we overcome these fears? Well, I believe that it all comes down to two things. Relationship building and a positive pitching environment. I'm going to quickly share one of the biggest lessons that I've ever learned when it comes to pitching and that is the three tens rule. This theory was introduced to me by Jordan Belford, the legendary wolf of Wall Street. While I wouldn't suggest following a lot of his life decisions, you may remember from the blockbuster film, at his core, Jordan is a brilliant salesman. And his biggest claim to fame is the three tens rule, and the concept is really pretty basic. Whoever you are trying to influence is going to be somewhere on the scale between absolutely certain and absolutely uncertain about you, your company, and your product, and your goal should be to get whoever you are pitching as close to a ten as possible in all three of those categories, starting with you. If you have never heard of this approach before, you are probably going into your pitches with the sole goal to sell your creative concept, which is obviously a very important step to the process, but not where you should begin. Before you can get the green light on your concept, whoever you are pitching needs to be sold on you. If whoever you are pitching doesn't have the full confidence in your personal abilities, then it's going to be so much harder to convince them to stand behind whatever it is you are trying to create. And there are four questions that I like to answer about myself before I start pitching others so they can be more confident in my character. And they are, am I trustworthy? A great way to establish trust is to be prepared. Are you easy to work with? This can be established through your communications and whether you are a problem solver or a problem creator. Are you the best creative for this particular project? You can ask if they have faced any challenges during this process in the past and then share how you would approach it in your own way. And what are your intentions? What do you as a creator want to get out of this partnership? Why do you want to work with this brand? And do you have the same values? Providing the answers to all of these questions, even if they haven't been asked, is going to provide clarity and confidence and be, help establish a relationship right from the start. So once you have established that fantastic relationship and provided them with the confidence in you, it's time to then serve, then sell. Number two is the serve then sell mentality. I'm going to start by saying that I love this mindset. It was first introduced to me on one of Jenna Kutcher's podcasts, which if you haven't gone down that rabbit hole, I highly suggest you do. And it totally changed my approach when it comes to pitching. When I look back on how I used to pitch a concept, I would typically begin with a quick introduction and then immediately dive into explaining my concept, the sell. I'd imagine this would leave whoever I was pitching, feeling super overwhelmed and probably pretty unheard. This approach was screaming, look at me! Instead of offering, what can I do for you? I was skipping the most important step and that is serving. The whole idea is simple. Before you can complete a transaction, whether that's in the form of money or a stamp of approval, you need to get the person to feel like they have been served. Let's think about it this way. Your server at a fancy restaurant, your goal is to make money, which may come in the form of an awesome tip from your customers. But in order to do so, you need to serve them. In this example, you can serve in a number of ways, like introducing yourself, starting a genuine conversation, providing suggestions, explaining the menu items, taking orders, bringing drinks and meals, keeping the table clean, and probably engaging in a lot more conversation as they're there. Once you have served, then you can bring the check. And if you did a good job, you might get a great tip. So as a content creator, I really want you to think about how you can serve your clients before you try to sell them your idea. And how could you do this? Well, you could ask them about their goals, listen to their challenges, provide some insight to engagement rates, share TikTok tips, just general social media tips, chat about what a successful campaign could look like. The list really goes on and on and on. You want to make it very clear that you understand their wants, their needs, and their desires. And for them to feel like you have genuinely served them. If they go into your pitch, feeling like they've already been served, then you have a much higher chance of convincing them that your concept is going to be a winner. This approach and mentality has been such a game changer for me when it comes to pitching, and it has actually led me to a ton of great relationships and yeses in the end. And all it takes is shifting your perspective to always serve that in sell. You may have heard the saying that done is better than perfect. And my goodness as a perfectionist, I love those words so much. So to really drive my next tip home, I've swapped out a couple words with hopes that it will stick with you as well. And that is that real is better than perfect. What I am trying to say is simple, you just need to be yourself. Don't put on an act while pitching. It's easy to forget that whoever you are trying to convince is just another human like you. And as humans, we make mistakes. We get emotional, we stumble over our words, or we have mind blanks. This is all totally normal. And guess what? I hate to break it to you. Pitching your ideas isn't going to be easy. You're probably going to get nervous, but don't let those nerves make you spiral into somebody that you're not. Nerves can make us get in our heads. Think and rethink our words, change face, alter our opinions. And in the end, this approach is super counterproductive. Changing yourself for the sake of landing a pitch is never a good idea and should really be avoided at all costs. Remember, you have been chosen to create this content for a reason. So staying true to who you are is both a sign of strength and competency. So when you are pitching, imagine you are sharing your ideas with a friend and don't be afraid to let your true emotion shine through. If you want to talk about your numbers, instead of just spitting out general analytics, try sharing a real case scenario about how those numbers left you feeling. This storytelling approach and vulnerability will come off less showbody and more genuine. And it will actually help keep the person on the other end more engaged. Remember, real is better than perfect. Okay, so before we move on to our final tip, let's do a really quick recap of what we have learned so far. You should now understand the importance of the three tens rule, which begins with providing the confidence that you are the best person to bring your vision to life. You have now established a strong relationship with whoever you are trying to pitch by adopting the serve, then salamontality, and you have genuinely served them. And you have the belief that real is always going to be better than perfect and to not let potential nerves change who you are. If you can commit to these first three steps, I promise you are going to have such a more positive mindset and more confidence as you head into your pitches. So we are now going to shift gears and chat about how to present your pitch with clarity in mind. Number four is providing clarity with a creative brief. All right, so you've drummed up this incredible concept in your imagination. In your head, you can picture every color, every camera movement, and even the music that you are going to edit your footage to. As far as you're concerned, it's a no-brainer. This next video is going to be a total slam dunk. Now, all you have to do is convince your team or your client to get on board as well. Should be easy, right? So you hop on a Zoom call, get into that positive pitching mindset, and start speaking through your vision. But the reality here is everyone interprets and imagines other people's ideas differently. I bet you can think back on a time where you left a scenario just like this thinking, gosh, I really wish I could have been more clear with my words and painted a better picture of my vision for everyone. Or worse, you leave under the impression that others did understand your vision, and then you put in all the work of creating your video, delivering the final product, and you're met with confusion instead of enthusiasm. So it's time to eliminate all of that second guessing and focus on achieving creative clarity because it's going to save you so much time in the long run. Now, it might seem easier to talk your client or your team through your vision, but from years of experience, we've learned that taking the extra 20 to 30 minutes to put together a creative brief for them to reference is always a good idea. And once you have that beautiful template locked down, it's pretty much a fill in the blank situation. So for sake of ease, our team develops all of our creative briefs in a platform called CANBA. And if you've been in the creative space for a while, you've probably heard of this, and you might even be using it daily. We find it to be a super great tool which is really user friendly and a total bonus that it's totally free. But you can really build out your creative briefs in whatever platform is going to work best for you. I've provided a PDF attached to this lesson so you can see our outline made in CANBA as an example, and I'm also going to give you a quick breakdown of each section. So let's open that up now. If we are pitching a brand or a client on an idea, we always begin our creative briefs with a title page that looks like this. We include a background image that relates to the concept, as well as the logos of the parties involved. It's a simple way to summarize what to expect from this document, especially if it might be landing in the inbox of someone who hasn't been a part of the entire creative journey. Now, if you work for a company and you're pitching an idea to your team, you could choose to skip this title page entirely. But remember, the very first page is your first impression. So you want it to be clean, you want it to be simple, and you want it to leave them wanting more. Next up is the aim. The aim is all about the goals, the wants, and the needs of whoever you are pitching. This short section is an explanation of how this content is going to help solve a problem and help them meet their goals. Keep the concept of serving in mind as we spoke about earlier while filling out this section. Next up is the concept. This is where you can provide a high-level overview of the concept you have in mind. But try to keep it to a paragraph or two. Sometimes I will even include an example of a voiceover or a script that I have in mind just to give a little bit more clarity. Don't overwhelm them with too many details, but make sure what you include gives them a good vision. Next up is the mood board. Most people at the creative space are visual learners. So this is why I like to gather a collection of images to help people better understand the tone, the mood, and the overall vision that you're trying to achieve. The photos should also be relevant to the concept, but don't think of them as linear or needing to tell a story. Canva has such a great library of stock images directly on their platform that you can pull from. Otherwise, I'd check out unsplash references. Are there similar examples that you can provide to help articulate your vision? These references can be a great tool to give a sneak peek of the tone, shooting style, and pacing that you're imagining. Obviously what you create will be different, but this is a great tool if there's anything you want to technically articulate or make them familiar with trends that you are trying to accomplish. And that's it. Sometimes you might want to include a music reference or a really in-depth script sample, but the overall framework stays the same. Of course you can adjust based on your own needs and branding, but the overall idea is that creating a visual package instead of relying on just your words is going to be so helpful in making others see your vision too. Remember, your content is your currency. So providing a vision that is clear and built with service in mind is how you can influence others to buy in. I hope all of these tools have been helpful and you feel more confident heading into your next pitch. Also, congrats! You have now completed the storytelling module of this course. We are now going to move into the pre-production phase, which once complete is going to have you feeling prepared as you head into your shoot day. We'll see you over there.
