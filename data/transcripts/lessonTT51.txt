 Welcome to the video editing mini series. Over the last decade, I've edited literally thousands of videos, some of them for some of the biggest brands in the world from Fairmont to Tide, Expedia to Doritos, and gotten literally hundreds of millions of views on social media. And these are the tips and tricks that I could not live without as an editor. Before we get into it, there's something extremely important that I need you to understand. And that is that great editing or camera tips and tricks are the cherry on top of a great video. So I don't want you to rely on any of the things that I teach you to help you achieve the things that you want to with social media. These are all meant to make the videos a little bit more interesting for the viewers to watch and a little bit more exciting for you to make. But great content comes from great ideas and everything that I'm going to teach you helps take great ideas to the next level. Everything that I'm going to teach you are editing foundations. So that means that even though I'm going to teach you how to do a specific trick or technique, you can use what I teach you and apply it in literally thousands of different ways. So even though what I'm teaching you might be a comment grab, you can use that same technique to do things like putting your friend in a fridge. I'm sure that's so confusing right now, but once you get into it, it's going to make a ton of sense. Something else that's important about this mini series is to know that I hate when a tutorial is 10 minutes long, when it could have been two minutes. So I'm going to try very hard to cut all of the fluff and make this as digestible as possible. So if I'm able to explain a technique in three minutes, I'm not going to make it a 15 minute video. I'm going to make it so simple for you. If you do miss anything, my suggestion is to go back to the beginning of the video and give it another watch because I'm sure it will make way more sense after you see it a few times. I'm also going to assume that you've already watched the DaVinci editing tutorial in this course. So we're going to be using all of the same keyboard shortcuts and techniques that you learned in that video. And if you need a refresher, feel free to hop back and give that a watch before you get into this because it's going to make everything a whole lot simpler. And there is one lesson that you will need Photoshop for, which is the frame extend. But I think it's like 15 bucks a month or something. So not too bad if that is something that you want to do. So like I said, I'm going to be cutting the fluff and making these videos as brief and valuable as possible. So let's get right into it.
