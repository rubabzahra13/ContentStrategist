 An extremely important aspect in course creation that could make the difference between a flop or a rocket ship is how you price your product. In this short lesson, I'm going to show you how we land on a price and how we test it for the best possible ROI or return on investment. Before we dive in, I want to touch on upsells and order bumps. If you don't know what those are, don't worry. When you're selling a course, you'll have your hero product, this is the main transformation that you're providing to your customers, but you have an opportunity to sell them on more products that are related to the main one. It's like when you're buying new jeans, and you're about to pay and you see a shirt you love so you add it to the cart. We're going to try and get the average amount of customer spends on their first visit as high as possible. This is also known as the average order value or AOV. Let me explain how that works for us. When someone lands on our checkout page, they have the option to add a $15 posting checklist to their order. Then after they purchase, they have the option to buy a video production course and a course specifically on creating great hooks. A lot of people sell their hero product extremely cheap and make all their money on the back end with upsells. So when you're considering the price of your course, you should be testing what the average order value is between your main product and your upsells and downsets. Okay, now let's get into how to price your course. The most important thing to remember here is you need to price your product based on fact, not your ego or self-consciousness. You might think your product is worth $3,000 with all the value it provides, but it could be more profitable at $100 because you can bring in a higher volume of customers. On the flip side, you might think nobody cares about what you're teaching and you should be selling it for $10 when you've actually solved a $100 problem for people. When we first launched our product, we tested every price point from $29 to $149. We did this by AB testing two landing pages, which you can do inside of Kajabi, each directing to a different price point. Kajabi will then give you data on which landing page converts better. We found that at both $29 and $149 for our hero product, we broke even with ads, but around $60 there was a sweet spot where our average order was $110 after upsells and our order bump. And we were bringing customers in for around $55. Having a relatively low price point compared to the value also meant we hardly got any refund requests and we could scale a lot quicker. Your product is going to have a sweet spot and you need to let the market decide on what that sweet spot is. Rather than putting your foot down and saying, I won't sell it for under $X. Or saying, there's no way anyone would be willing to pay X. You might be worried about what customers will think if they see two different prices for the product. I know I was when we first started, but here's what we found. If someone was upset because they paid $150, then saw it for $50. We decided we would reimburse the difference to them, but that literally never happened once. In fact, we've had numerous students see the sale price and comment that they spent nearly double on the course and it was worth every penny. If you make a great product, people are going to feel it's worth whatever they pay. If the idea still makes you uncomfortable or you have a large audience already, so people would definitely notice, you can set your price point high and test different discounts. So for example, set your price at $150 and test it with a 50% discount. Then when you have data on the cost to bring in a customer or what percentage of people you're able to convert into customers, try it at full price and see whether it becomes more profitable with higher price and lower volume. Your audience will be happy because they got it for 50% off and no one will be upset that the price went up because everyone understands that businesses run sales. Let's talk about how to increase the average order value for every customer. I'd say the majority of course creators are content breaking even on their main hero product because they make all their profit on additional upsells, downsells and order mumps as well as selling future products down the road through email. This can be everything from a PDF you add for $10 below the checkout to a $500 course you sell to people who have just purchased the main product. We'll show you where those actually live inside could job you later on in this course. You can also include one-on-one coaching or group coaching. We started a program called FYP Insiders where members pay a monthly subscription to be part of a community where they get weekly group coaching and additional support. Kajabi makes this easy since they have a built-in community feature that you can sell as a subscription offer. Just like most things in life, course creation compounds. A longer you do it, the more you'll have to sell people and the more value you'll be able to provide. Don't get discouraged if you're breaking even at the beginning because as you make your funnel better and create more valuable offerings, the business will grow. So to summarize, test your pricing, try a higher and lower than you think it's worth to find your sweet spot. Then find ways to increase your average order value so that even if your main offer is breaking even, you can profit on the back end. With that, I will see you in the next lesson.
