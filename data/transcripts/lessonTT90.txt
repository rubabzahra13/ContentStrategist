 In this lesson, we're going to talk about email broadcast strategy and the three core email sequences you need to know as a course creator and how you're going to optimize them. So to begin, what's the difference between an email sequence and an email broadcast? Email sequences are automated emails that are sent to customers through different stages of their journey. You can set them up once and they'll run forever, although you should probably update every so often. So for example, when someone purchases one of your courses, they'll automatically get subscribed to an email sequence with daily emails for one week, helping them to get the most out of the product. Whereas broadcasts are one time emails sent to announce something special, send timely updates, and to nurture your audience with up-to-date info. If you plan on doing a weekly newsletter, this is the category it will fall under. More on all of this shortly. So let's begin by walking through our three core email sequences. We take every single customer through at different stages of their journey, starting with the welcome or post-purchase sequence. This is a series of emails your customers will receive right after they hit purchase. Our welcome sequence is made up of seven emails, one sent per day of the week after they purchase. This sequence can really be as long or short as you wish. This series of emails is going to get your customers comfortable with you and upsell them into any offers they may need while they're at their warmest. Starting with day zero, or the email they get instantly. And that's how to log in an any important info they need to get started on their course. Day one is an invitation to join our Facebook community. Day three is an email about my experience learning the importance of a strong hook and inviting them to join our Art of Hooks creator course at a discount. Day four is a case study of a student who had a big win. To give them confidence that what they purchased really does work. A6 is an email about how they can plan out their content, which is an additional free tool for them to use. Once our new students complete this sequence, they are then moved into our evergreen email list where they receive one to two broadcast emails per week from us. The second sequence you'll want to set up is your course completion sequence. You can set this up in Kajabi, so as soon as the student completes the last lesson of your course, they are moved into this sequence. This is another great customer touch point to celebrate their success and encourage further learning if you have any more products to offer them. We've kept ours super simple and it looks like this. Day zero, or the instant email. Congrats, here's what's next. This is an email where we recognize their accomplishment, tell them to keep in touch in our Facebook community and encourage them to start our 30 day challenge to put what they've learned into practice. This challenge basically just gives them a roadmap of what to do next. So I know, I highly suggest adding a challenge to the end of your course if what you teach requires them to practice consistently to get those results. Day two is an art of hooks course push. Based on feedback from students, we found that the hook writing is where they struggled most, which is why we added an invite into our art of hooks course, post completion in case they need any of that additional support. As I mentioned, our post purchase sequence right now is only made up of a couple emails. You can make this as long or as short as you wish. The last sequence you're going to want to set up is a freebie sequence. This is specifically important if you are running ads to a free guide, but you can also offer a freebie on your website for people to opt into as well. Again, this sequence can be as long as you'd like, but you'll probably want to do some testing. Think about providing a ton of value in the first couple of days, and then offering that slam dunk offer, your paid solution, to their biggest problems. This sequence is a little bit longer, so I've included a list of what ours looks like in the lesson description. You'll want to create customized sequences for every customer entry point across your different funnels, but these three core sequences are a really great starting point. What's great is you can duplicate entire email sequences in Kajabi and just swap out the key information. I think we now have about 25 different sequences in the back end of Kajabi running at all times, nurturing our customers at all stages of their journey, but I really don't want this to overwhelm you. You can just start with the three I listed above. Now, let's chat about your weekly email or your broadcast strategy. This is how you are going to continue to nurture and sell to your customers long after they have completed that welcome sequence. This is going to look different for everybody, depending on how often you want to send your emails, but I'll share what we do and you can tweak based on your own goals. So I like to split our broadcast into two buckets, value or nurture emails and sales emails. A value email is all about providing content that enriches your subscribers' lives without directly asking for a sale. The goal here is to educate, entertain, and inspire your audience and build that trust with them. A few types of value emails are how-to's, industry insights, personal lessons you've learned, some free resources, video trainings, customer case studies, or simply questions or prompts that encourage replies from your subscribers. A sales email, on the other hand, is designed to convert subscribers into paying customers or increase the lifetime value of an already paying customer. These emails directly advertise your courses, downloads, or any special offers like discounts, limited time deals, or exclusive bundles. Think black Friday sales or flash sales. Sales emails should be used super strategically, while value emails should be your go-to. I always aim for one to two value emails a week and sprinkle in sales emails here and there. Your job is to find a balance of value and sales emails that resonate well with your email subscribers. This two type of email system might seem way too simple to be effective, but trust me, it works. I've added a couple examples of each in the download section of this lesson so you can see the difference between sales and value emails. There you have it, a crash course on email strategy for course creators. Overall, my biggest piece of advice is to keep it human. Remember, they're just real people on the other end of your emails and they want you to talk to them like a friend, not a corporation. Provide value, encouragement, and inspiration if you want them to keep opening up those emails.
