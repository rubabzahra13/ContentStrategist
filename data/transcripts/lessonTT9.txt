 I believe that editing is always faster with 10 fingers than it is with two thumbs. So I'm going to be showing you the fastest and most efficient way to edit your TikToks using a free program called DaVinci Resolve. Let's get right into it. Alright, first things first. If you've never used DaVinci before, we're just going to go ahead and download it. So to do this, you can just go to Google, type DaVinci Resolve, and you'll get sent to a page where you can hit free download now, and it will ask what browser you're using. So download what's right for you and go through all the steps so that it's on your computer. Now, there's two versions of DaVinci. One that's free, one that is one time payment. Honestly, there's pretty much nothing that you're going to need in the paid version for TikTok editing. So definitely go with the free version for now. So once that's downloaded onto your computer, you can click to open it up. This is your project's Windows. Anytime you save a project, this is where it's going to go. It lives in a library on your computer, but you don't really need to worry about that for right now. For now, we're just going to hit Untitled Project, and that's going to start a new project for us. Now, before we get into any kind of editing, I'm going to start off by getting you to import our keyboard shortcuts. So if you go to the top left, DaVinci Resolve, and hit Keyboard Customization. Now in the lesson description is a .txt file called FYP underscore DaVinci underscore shortcuts. This is going to be your keyboard shortcuts. So we're going to hit these three dots on the top right, and we're going to go import preset. Then find where you save the shortcuts preset and click open. So this is going to load in all of our keyboard shortcuts, which we're going to be using throughout this video. So now we're in the program, and you can see at the bottom are these tabs. The only ones we're going to be touching are the Edit tab, which is the one that we're on right now. The Color tab, which we'll be touching on at the end, and the Delivery tab, which is how you export the videos before you post it to TikTok. So let's start with the Edit tab. Now, it's going to be easiest to explain this by actually jumping into an edit. So we're going to do that now. If you have a video that you're ready to edit, I suggest following along and doing the steps with me. But if not, watch and then come back later when you do have a video that you're ready to start with. So first things first, we're going to find all of the clips that we're going to be using to edit this video. So minor in this folder here, I'm going to select them all, and I'm going to drag them to this media pool. It asks if we want to change the project frame rate, which we're going to say change. And now all of our clips are populated in this top left box. We're going to be re-editing a video that makes shot a few weeks ago, which now has over 7 million views. So the very first thing before we get into the edit is to go down to this gear in the bottom right hand corner. Because most video is horizontal and we're going to be doing a vertical video, we need to change the settings. So we're going to hit use vertical resolution here. So the resolution is going to be 1080 by 1920, which is the standard for TikTok. Hit save. Now what we're going to do is go through and start piecing together our video. So if you hover over one of these clips that you brought in and double click, you'll see it pulls up into the top middle. So this is where you can preview the clip before you put it into your timeline. So we're going to scrub through until we find the part that we want. Apparently Jackfruit, you look and taste like pulled pork. So how many of it has an opportunity to try to trick my husband? That's perfect. So we're going to go to the beginning of that and we're going to hit four. So what this does is it sets an endpoint for the clip, meaning that's the beginning of the section that you want to use. We're then going to hit spacebar to play through the clip. So when you use it as an opportunity to try to trick my husband? Spacebar again to stop when you're at the end of the clip that you want to use, hit five. So that sets an out point. So that's the end of the clip that you want to use. And then if you hit six, it's going to drop it right into your timeline. So hit four for your endpoint, five for your out point and six to drop it into the timeline. This is going to be super important. Now if your timeline is too small like mine, you can see this plus and minus bar over here. We're just going to drag this up, make it a little bit bigger so that we can see. Perfect. Okay, now we're going to start doing this for the rest of the clips. So we're going to be clicking on our preview, grabbing the part that we want to use for the endpoint, space to play it, five for the out point, six to drop it in, and just doing that for all of our clips. Right now you're just trying to get the bones of the edit in. So you just want to take that idea that you have in your mind for the video and just place it out into the timeline. Once we finish that, that's when we're going to get into all of the editing details that are specific to TikTok, like cutting the rolls, making everything as quick as possible, and cutting any messaging that just doesn't need to be there. Okay, now this last clip is a really long one. Rather than just going through and cutting out all the selections that I want, I'm going to show you a faster way of doing this by just dropping the entire clip in. It's going to make a lot of sense in the moment. So we're just going to play this through really quick. Right off the bat, it doesn't feel like we need this second clip. But one of the most important things as an editor is being able to tell what doesn't need to be there. So this clip doesn't actually add to the video. It's not funny, it's not more interesting. It doesn't give any more information that is necessary for the video to land. So it doesn't need to be there. So what we're going to do is we're going to highlight this clip and we're going to hit S. Now what that does is it deletes the clip and it pulls all the clips after it back over. So we're going to play this through again. As you can see, we have a tail to that clip that we don't need. What we're going to do is we're going to hit spacebar and watch through and hit spacebar at the moment we think that it should be switching to a different clip. So right there, the moment she stops talking and we're going to hit E. What E does is it deletes the end of the clip and pulls the rest of the clips back over. So I'm going to show you one more time what I mean by this. So you can see that the clip keeps going on the right and when I hit E, everything to the right of it is going to move over to this playhead, which is the part of the video that we're currently on. If any of this is confusing, maybe just give this a few watches, try and follow along because I promise this will make your life so much easier in the long run. Now before we get too much further, we're just going to hit command S and we're going to save this because you never know when you're going to run out of battery or something's going to crash. It's always good to just keep saving throughout. So Jackfruit project, save and that's going to go to that project manager that I showed you at the beginning of this video. Okay, watching again from the beginning. Now for this intro clip, it feels like she talks to camera for quite a bit. It's an interesting enough hook that that's okay and with the video that got posted, that's what we ended up going with. But here's something that you can do if you want to make it just a little bit more interesting. So we're going to watch through. So that's the end of a phrase and now we're going to hit W. What W does is it splits the clip at the playhead. So the part of the clip that we're on, it's just going to draw a line right there and split it. So now what we can do is with this second part of the clip, you can select it, go to the top right where it says zoom and just zoom in a little bit. We're then going to pull the position up so that she's still in the frame and what this does is it punches in on your subject. So this is used a lot for emphasis or if you're just trying to keep a shot interesting and I'll show you what that looks like. Apparently Jackfruit is looking tastes like pulled pork so I'm going to use it as an opportunity to try to trick him. It's subtle and a lot of the time you probably wouldn't even notice that it's there but it makes a massive difference in keeping a viewer's attention. Okay, this is feeling pretty good. I'm going to just drag this down so that I can see this audio a little bit better. Once I do that I can see there's a bit of space at the end of this clip here so we're going to do the E trick again. Put the playhead right where the audio ends and hit E and that's going to pull all of this back. So for the rest of the video it's one tripod shot of Megan Ey talking. So rather than going through and pulling each selection, what we're going to do is we're going to watch through and at the beginning of every phrase we're going to hit Q. So what Q does is it deletes the beginning of the clip. So you can see that there's a lull before the audio starts up. So when I hit Q it's just going to pull that clip back and delete that part of the clip that we don't want. So once she finishes talking we're going to hit W which remember puts a cut into that track. We're going to pull the playhead right to before I start talking and hit Q which is going to delete everything back. Now most of this editing is just Q, W and E. Q to delete the beginning of the track, W to put a slice in the track and E to delete the end of it. It might be confusing now but it's going to be second nature in no time. So as you can see I'm just going through and I'm just cutting all of this blank space here. So at this point you have a rough outline of your video and it's a little bit longer than what it's going to end up being. So what we're going to do is we're going to watch through and just use the S command to delete any of the clips that we don't feel need to be there. I don't think the big Pinterest gal adds much so I'm just going to hit S and delete it and we're just going to go through and do that for the entire video. Now I'm going to quickly show you how the color tab works and this isn't something you're going to need to spend much time on for TikTok but I'm going to show you a few things that you can do just to make your videos pop a little bit. Moving into the color tab it's going to be really intimidating to look at to start but basically what you need to know is this box right here is a node. That's where all of your color changes are going to live. So we're going to click on that and we're going to go over to this circle with the dot in the middle and this is called our color wheels pretty much everything that we're going to do lives in here. So lift is the shadows of your clip. So this is the mid tones and gain is the highlight. So let's just say we wanted to raise up the highlights of this video. All we're going to do is take this bar underneath gain and drag it to the right. As you can see it's going to completely blow it out when we move it all the way to the right. You can hit this arrow to just reset what you've done and there's going to be a sweet spot just a couple points above. Another good thing to adjust is the contrast. I like to add just a little bit because you will lose some contrast when you export the video and then saturation. Usually between five and ten depending on the video. You can also drop your lift down just to create a little bit more contrast and that's looking pretty good. So if you hit command D you can see the before and after of that clip. It's subtle but it's just going to help to make it stand out from the other clips on TikTok just a little bit. So now we're going to add that same adjustment to all of the videos. Hit this clips tab in the top right and when you do you'll get this row of clips in the bottom here. So this first one is the one that we added the color adjustment to. We're going to click on the second one, scroll to the right and select the last one while holding shift. Now we're going to right click on the clip that we did edit and go apply grade. You're going to replace and now all of the clips are going to have that same color that we changed to the first one. If you're already feeling overwhelmed by the color tab I'll get you to skip past this next part but if you're still with me I want to show you one important detail. So you can see in this clip I am way too shadowed. The rest of the clip looks pretty good but I'm very dark. So what we're going to do is we're going to hold option and hit S. What this does is it creates a new box that we can put color into. So this is where we did the first color. This other box is going to be our new color tab. So now we're going to hit this circle with the four dots around the outside and then we're going to hit this circle here. What this is doing is it's going to be creating an adjustment to one specific part of the clip and then we're going to drag this over the part that we want to adjust which is going to be me right here. Now because we did that any adjustments that we make are only going to happen within that circle. So we're going to come back to the first tab, the circle with the dot in the middle and we're going to raise our midtones. Because that's mostly where we're losing me here. We can raise a bit of the lift as well because it looks like it's shadows but we don't want it to look washed out. Okay that looks a lot better. Click on that color box and hold command and click D. So you can see the before and after. As you can see this makes a massive, massive difference in how good this clip looks. So I'm going to highlight the rest of these that are still way too dark. Right click on the first one and click apply grade. Replace done. Alright that is the basics of the color tab. So we're going to go back to the edit tab and I'm just going to run you through a few more things that are going to be good to know as you're editing. Let's talk audio. So you can see here that the audio changes a lot throughout this video. So you can adjust that manually by clicking on a clip that looks like it has lower audio. Go over to the audio tab in the top right next to video and then you can raise or lower the volume of that specific track. So you can see how much that changes in the timeline. Ready to go through the video and just make sure that everything is relatively level. Now when you're done editing and you have a video that you're happy with, go to the very end of the final clip and click into the timeline. Now you're going to hit your left arrow key one time and hit oh. So what this does is it sets an outpoint for the entire video. So this is how DaVinci knows what you want to export. Now we're going to go to the deliver tab on the far right and we're going to hit custom export. This is where you can put in your file name and you can set a location. So I have one folder where I put all of my final videos but you can also keep it in the same folder where you have your project. Make sure you're on single clip and everything should be pulled in automatically but just make sure that you're in quick time for the format. H264 for the codec and 1080 by 1920 for the resolution. Everything else should automatically pull in there and we're going to hit add to render Q. From there just hit render all and your video is going to render into the folder that you selected. It's that easy. I'm going to go through a few more tips and frequently asked questions that you might run into as you start editing. So if the QWE commands aren't working the way that you want them to, you want to make sure that you're not currently selecting a clip. So if I have this highlighted and I try to hit Q, it's just not going to work for me. Then if I click outside of there so nothing is selected, hit Q, it does exactly what I want it to. So if something's not working, try just selecting outside of the clips. Another keyboard shortcut that's going to save you a lot of time is hold command and hit E. This is going to select the clip that you currently on as well as all of the clips to the right of it. This way rather than having to highlight the entire video, if you just hit command E, you can take and drag all of those clips to the right of the playhead. Really nice. Now let's say you want to do a dramatic zoom on a subject. I'm going to show you how to do that super easily. You're going to go to this dynamic zoom tab on the top right and toggle it on. Then we're going to hit swap. What this is going to do is create an automatic zoom in. By default, it does a pretty dramatic zoom in depending on how long your clip is. So if you want to change that, you're going to go to the bottom left of the clip here where you see this drop down next to a box and we're going to go dynamic zoom. Now you're going to see there's a green box on the outside and a red box inside. We're going to select the red box and we're just going to pull that so that it's a little bit closer to the green box. What this does is it's setting an in and an outpoint for the zoom. If I were to go like this, it's going to do an extremely dramatic zoom. Never what you want. So we're going to do a nice subtle zoom where it's hardly pushing in at all and it just helps to keep the frame moving a little bit. If you want to speed up or slow down your clips, again, that's super easy. You just come down here, go speed change in this tab and you can just drag this slider to the percentage that you want. So this is mostly going to be if you're doing time lapses or if it's a B roll shot that just feels a little bit too slow, you can speed that up super easily. Now in the bottom left, you'll see we have an effects tab. So if you want to add text or any other kind of effects, you can take those and just drag them on top of your clip. So this is where you update the text and you can change all of the settings for it right underneath. For the most part, we like to use in app text because we feel like it belongs on the platform a little bit better. But if you have your own brand or you're looking to just stand out from the crowd a little bit more, this is a good way to do it. All right, those are the TikTok editing basics for DaVinci Resolve. There's so much more that goes into this program. And for now, those are the basics to get you going and be the fastest, most efficient editor possible. Once those keyboard shortcuts become second nature, you are going to be an editing wizard. I promise.
