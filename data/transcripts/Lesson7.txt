 It's time to put everything you've learned together. In this lesson, we're going over the secret sauce. I am presenting to you the hook creation formula, a guide to constructing hooks with a perfect blend of context, clarity, and curiosity. Creating effective hooks is both an art and a science. All things considered, I'd say we spend about 80% of our time in content creation, just working on the first 5 seconds of every video. Because if people don't make it past your hook, it doesn't really matter how much time or effort you put into the rest of the video, because nobody's ever going to see it. We've created a structured formula, which can serve as a roadmap for creating effective and repeatable hooks every time. The hook formula we created is based on a subjective rating system. Designed to keep you honest while judging your hooks. The three most important elements that every hook needs is one. Curiosity. If my phone died after the first 5 seconds, would I lose sleep wondering how the video ends? Number two, context. Do I have a full picture of what's happening and where the video is going? And three, clarity. Has the hook made it as easy as possible to understand? As you come up with your hook ideas for your videos, you're going to go through our checklists and create each element on a scale from 1 to 5. Then, after giving each one a rating, you'll add those 5 numbers together and aim for a score of 20 or higher. You might be thinking, shouldn't I be aiming for a perfect 25 out of 25? And what you'll find is there's times where you should skip an element on purpose to create the most clear and concise hook possible. For example, if the hook is spoken clearly to cam, sometimes a text block becomes redundant and actually takes away from the overall video. Use your judgment and make sure curiosity, context, and clarity are your North Star. We've provided a document with a full breakdown on the criteria that you can use before posting your video. So let's go over each element one more time and what we'll be judging on. Number one, how effective is your verbal hook? Does it clearly convey the value that your audience will receive in a way that creates a sense of intrigue? Have you avoided giving away the payoff of the video? If your phone died after hearing the verbal hook, would you lose sleep wondering where the video goes? Based on these questions, give yourself a rating out of 5. Number two, are you utilizing a text hook to provide additional context? If someone is watching without audio, could this convince them to tune in and watch until the end? How could you increase curiosity with just a few words? Again, give yourself a score out of 5. Number three, the visual hook. Did you utilize subtle and subliminal gestures or body movements? Do you have striking imagery or color? Will this video stand out alone without sound? Rated out of 5. Number four, the audio hook. What unique sound elements did you use to captivate your audience? Do you have a unique tone of voice, interesting music, natural landscape sounds, intriguing sound effects? Is the audio clear, crisp, and easy to understand? Finally, number five, will your post-caption serve as a hail marry to grab people's attention and create curiosity before they have a chance to scroll? Does it hint at an outcome without giving away the payoff? Have you used it as a way to relate to your audience or create conversation in the comments? Score it out of 5. Now that we've thought through each individual element and scored them all from 1 to 5, let's add it all together and see where you're at. If you landed anywhere below 20 out of a possible 25 points, you should consider looking into the elements which are lacking and trying to do better. It's important to remember that you don't ever have to have a perfect 25 out of 25. The goal here is to break down your hooks into more tangible sections and make incremental improvements to increase the overall effectiveness of your hooks. Alright, that was a lot. Let's conclude this thing and get you on your way to being a hook master. A master hooker. Now, there's a genie out there waiting to make all of your hopes and dreams come true. So let's make it happen.
