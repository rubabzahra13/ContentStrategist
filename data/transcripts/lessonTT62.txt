 In this lesson, we'll be covering all of the essential terms you need to know to get started with MediaBind. I'm gonna throw a ton at you here. So I've included a cheat sheet in the lesson description that you can reference if we ever mention something that you don't fully understand. Fair warning, this is definitely going to get dry, but it's absolutely crucial to understand everything I lay out in this lesson, and after this, it's going to get so much more exciting. So let's dive in. All right, in no particular order, let's go over some definitions. CPA, also known as cost per acquisition. This is the mother of all metrics. CPA is how much it costs you every time someone makes a purchase from your ad. This is the most important number to watch as a media buyer, and it's what you'll be focusing on constantly. It doesn't matter how many people are clicking on your ads or opting into your email list if nobody is buying. Metal will show your ad to a dramatically different quality of customers day by day. But your business can be just as successful with a ton of poor quality traffic as it is with a small amount of really great quality traffic. We've seen this day in and out. All of this is just to say that you should measure performance based on how much it costs you to get someone to buy rather than any metrics related to how many people see or click on your ad. All of the other metrics will help you understand where you might be losing a potential buyer or where you can improve your funnel. But at the end of the day, if your goal is to make sales, then the most important number to track is how much it's costing you to make that happen. It's also important to note that often ad platforms don't have perfect tracking. It might say you got three sales when you actually have five. So this number will need to be cross reference with actual data from the site you're selling from. More on that later, but make sure CPA is cemented in your brain as the most important metric to track. Next is CPC or cost per click. This is how much it costs for someone to click on your ad and it includes liking, sharing, reacting or commenting. This metric will help you to see whether your ad is interesting enough for people to actually engage with it. Then similar, but very different is cost per link click. This is the amount you pay for someone to click on the link in your ad that goes to your landing page. In my opinion, most people in the marketing world believe this number is more important than it actually is because not all clicks are created equally. You can get a lot of clicks for cheat, but get zero sales, which is no bueno or only a few expensive clicks that actually become sales. We've had times in our ad journey where it's costing us 30 cents to get a click and times where cost per click is $6. So guess which one was more profitable. They were actually the exact same. So while this metric is valuable to make sure people are actually taking action on your ad, it should not be your main pillar to decide whether an ad is doing well or not. Next is going to be your link click through rate, which we refer to as CTR. This is the percentage of people who click on your ad, then see it and go to your landing page. So if 100 people saw your ad and five people click through, that means you have a 5% click through rate or CTR. To higher the percentage, the more people felt compelled to click after seeing the ad. It can be tempting to look at industry averages for click through rate to tell if you're doing a good job, but since it depends completely on the quality of traffic being sent to your ad, this is a metric you should mostly be using to gauge how your ads stack up against one another. Our overall click through rate for the last $4 million ad spend was 3% with some as low as 1% and some above 8%. Prior to CPC, you want to make sure you're looking at link click through rate and not just click through rate, which would include things like reactions, comments and shares. Next is CPM or cost per 1000 impressions. This is the metric that ad platforms use to gauge how much you're paying for people to see your ad. Once again, this is a number that will vary greatly depending on the niche and quality of traffic being sent to your ad. We find especially running ads in different countries globally, this number varies massively. Over our last $4 million ad spend, the CPM was around $18 per 1000 impressions. Moving on to TOF or top of funnel. Top of funnel ads are meant to be your first touch point with a potential customer. They usually introduce people to your product and reach the largest audience possible. We call people who are unfamiliar with your product a cold audience. Next is M.O.F or middle of funnel. At this point, people are familiar with you and your product or service, also known as a warm audience. People in the middle of your funnel are going to build trust with your audience members and give them more information about you and your product or service. Then we have B.O.F or bottom of funnel. These are the ads that people see when they're almost committed to buying your product or service. They help get people over the edge and take action. Then we have frequency. This is the average number of times someone sees your ad. So if your frequency is one, everyone has seen your ad one time. If it's two, everyone has seen it twice on average. This number is important for a couple of reasons. One, it tells you whether your ad is top of funnel or bottom of funnel. Ads that are introducing people to your product typically have a lower frequency than ads that are bottom of funnel and pushing the sale. Keeping an eye on this number also tells you whether an ad is fatiguing or your bombarding your audience too much with the same creative. Roads or return on ad spend. I just like saying that one. This tells you how much you're making off of what you're putting into your ads. If you're breaking even, you have a row as of one. I'll give you another example. Let's say you made $300 profit and you spent $200 on ads. $300 divided by $200 is $1.5, which is your row as. ROI or return on investment. This is very similar to row as, but it looks at your investment as a whole. So you take your total profit divided by your total costs, which will include ads, salaries, office rent, subscriptions, etc. So let's say this year we made $5 million profit. And our total costs were 3 million. Our ROI would be a 1.67. Clear? As mud? AOV or average order value. This is how much money people are spending the first time they buy from you. If you sell clothes and the average person buys two pairs of jeans and a shirt, that's the average order value. The average order value for our business is around $110. Because we have a $58 main offer and upsells between $40 and $300. LTV or lifetime value. This is the total amount that people spend with you in their lifetime as a customer. Starbucks estimates they make $14,000 on average from every customer. So they might lose money getting the first sale, but they make it back big time in the long run. Let's say you have a low average order value, but either a subscription or high percentage of repeat customers that create a high lifetime value. It's going to be important for you to watch your cash flow as you run ads. For example, if it costs you $50 to acquire a customer and they're buying a $10 monthly subscription, it will take you five months to earn that initial investment back as long as you can keep them for that five months. After that, it will be all profit. That's an amazing business model, but you'll either need a lot of money to survive while you're earning that investment back or a lot of patients to grow slowly as your customers become more profitable. Moving on, fatigue. We're talking about ads. Fatigue is when your ad starts to lose momentum because people are getting tired of seeing it. So, you know, you're going to have a lot of money to get your ads that we've put over a million dollars into over the last year that still haven't fatigued and ads that fatigue in a few weeks. This will depend on factors like how enjoyable or valuable the ad is to your audience, as well as how many people on the planet might be interested in the thing that you're selling. If your product is applicable to a hundred million people, your ads will take a lot longer to fatigue than if they're interesting to one million people. We'll be explaining how to know whether your ads are fatiguing later in the course. Your pixel and API. You're going to be hearing a lot about pixels and APIs throughout this course. A pixel and an API are essentially the ways that meta-tracks how many people are buying a product on your website. This tracking is extremely important because the algorithm needs to know who bought your product so it can send your ads to more people like that person. Without a pixel or API, the algorithm is running blind and can't optimize your ads or get them to the right audience. The process for setting up a pixel and or an API are different depending on what platform you're using to sell your products. Most platforms have detailed and easy to follow instructions on linking a pixel from meta, so I recommend googling how to set up meta tracking for the platform that you're using. Be patient with this process because it can feel challenging, but it will make the difference between breaking even or making a million dollars this year. Upsell. This is when you offer an upgrade or a more expensive product related to what's already being purchased after they pay for the initial item in the checkout. The purpose is to increase the average order value. A lot of people promote a $7 product which would lose money by itself but then upsell a $300 product after the initial item is sold. This can make the difference between losing money and doing extremely well with ads. Downsell. This is when you offer a cheaper alternative when someone says no to the upsell helping to salvage a potential loss sale. Cross sell. This is when you suggest other products to the customer after their initial purchase. The purpose is to increase your LTV. Order bump. Often you can easily increase your average order value by having a small addition during the checkout process that people can add onto their order. Don't underestimate a good order bump. We have a simple $15 one click order bump for our course and it's earned over $800,000 in the last 18 months. CBO or campaign budget optimization. This is when you let the ad platform choose the budget for your entire campaign. It will decide based on performance what ads to give the budget to meaning all you need to do is give it an overall budget and it will do the rest. So imagine you have 20 ads and you're spending $100 a day. You're telling the platform to disperse the money however it sees fit amongst those 20 ads. While this is the root a lot of media buyers go it gives you a lot less control when it comes to testing and scaling new creative. So we prefer the next option which is ABO or ad set budget optimization. Unlike CBO, ABO allows you to control the budget for every ad set. This gives you more control over where the money is being spent which can be great once you gain confidence in your ability as a media buyer. Look a like audience. This is a tool within ad platforms that creates an audience by mirroring another audience, typically using a list of past customers. Algorithms have the ability to automatically create look like audiences behind the scenes, making them much less relevant than they were 10 years ago. Cost cap. This is a campaign type where you tell the platform how much you're willing to spend to make a sale and it spends more or less depending on whether it's able to hit that target. This is something we've tested extensively and found more volatile so we haven't stuck with it in the long run. Hookrate. The video hookrate is a custom metric to see how many people continue to watch after the first three seconds. This is an extremely important metric because if you're losing the majority of your audience in the first three seconds, you know that the problem is your hook and finding a better way to grab someone's attention to bring them into the content. To calculate hookrate, you take the number of three second video play as divided by the number of total impressions. We found a good hookrate is anywhere between 20 and 45%. If the hookrate is below 20%, it's assigned to find a more compelling first five seconds for your video. Holdrate. The holdrate is out of everyone who made it past three seconds, the percentage that got to 15 seconds. So for example, if 100 people watched past your hook but you lose 50 before 15 seconds, your holdrate is 50%. Generally, we find a good holdrate is between 20 and 45%. Hook and holdrate can be calculated differently depending on the marketer so it's hard to look at industry averages but this is what we like to go with. While there are many more definitions that you'll see while in the back end of any ad manager, these are the ones that are most important for you to know. I've attached a cheat sheet with these definitions so you can find them when they come up. So this may have felt like drinking through a fire hose if you're new to running ads before long, this is all going to be second nature. Now that you know what all the jargon means, it's time to get into the meat of how to run a successful ad campaign. Let's dive in.
