 At this stage, your video is complete, the creation part of your job is done, and now it's time to shift into launch mode. It's finally time to share your video with the world. But hitting that post button can actually be a really emotional experience for people. Feelings of stress, fear, imposter syndrome, pride, nerves, excitement, can all come barreling to the surface, which can be really overwhelming on your launch day. And what many people don't understand is that hitting post on Instagram or TikTok or whatever platform you're using shouldn't be where your launch either starts or ends. Over the years, we've learned that a successful launch should include a number of actions, including manifesting, communicating, engaging, measuring, reflecting, and even detaching. Systemizing and streamlining your launch will help the process feel more natural and not like an emotional roller coaster. Plus, it will also help you get better results in the end. So in this lesson, I'm going to share the launch strategy that has worked for us here at One Peak, which we like to break down into four simple phases. Hype, post, engage, and detach. It's time to feel more confident going into every launch and use the results to grow and improve as a content creator. Let's get it. Number one, the hype phase. The goal of this phase is simple. To get yourself and your audience hyped up about your video. This is where manifesting your results and creating a buzz come into play. But let's start with you. I want to share a simple practice that will not only get you even more excited about what you've created, but also be such a great tool to help you work towards your biggest goals. And that is called manifesting results. So in previous lessons, we have chatted about your big goals and dreams for yourself as a content creator. You have envisioned what you want your future life to look like, and now you are on the journey of getting there. This hype phase of your launch is now your chance to manifest the results you want to see from each video and help pave the way to reaching your biggest goals. So before you rush and hit that post button, I want you to visualize what would make this particular video feel like a success to you. Not how your boss or how your client will measure success, but what will make you feel like this video was a true win. Really tune in and ask yourself, what result do I want to receive from putting this video out into the world? The key here is to get as specific as possible and try to link your answer back to your biggest goals. Push yourself to being more intentional than saying, I want 100 new followers. Really think about what result would leave you feeling genuinely fulfilled and be a stepping stone to your growth as a content creator. Here's a few examples so you can understand what I'm talking about. I want this video to encourage 20 new people to sign up for my holiday e-cook book because I love growing my community and encouraging them to live a healthy lifestyle. I want this video to be my first to receive over 100,000 views so I can use it as a case study for future brand partnerships. I want this video to be shared by someone who inspires me with hopes to begin a new online relationship. This practice is super important because it will not only help bring your small goals to the surface, but it's also going to help you keep dreaming big. I'd suggest creating a note in your phone or a Google Doc file where you can write down your manifestations for every piece of content and each week take 5 minutes to reflect on them. This is a great way to keep yourself accountable as you work towards your goals as a content creator. Hopefully incorporating this practice prior to hitting post will help you celebrate the small wins and provide a lot of guidance for your future creative decisions. Now that you're all hyped up about what this video could do for you, it's time to get your audience excited too. I'm going to share a couple of quick tips that have worked for us to help get people invested in your content before you even go to post it. Let's start by talking about behind the scenes. While you are filming your content, try capturing a few behind the scenes clips that you can use to spark curiosity and encourage people to look forward to your video launch. On Instagram, you could share these prior to your launch by Instagram Stories or by creating a reel. And on TikTok, you could post a couple quick clips showing some bloopers with a like for full video CTA at the end. We use this tactic for all of our big video launches as we find people love to see the real side of the content creation process. Lifting the curtain is a great way to show that you're willing to be vulnerable with both your existing audience and your new viewers. Behind the scenes content is a great way to serve your audience before you share something that might include a potential self. Test a consistent launch time. Another great tip is to launch your content at consistent launch times to try to create a natural buzz of anticipation. This more so relates if you have an ongoing video series and you want people to follow along with it. You might find this tip especially beneficial if you are the type of creator who thrives on a schedule and also thrives on accountability. So as a quick example, our team used to have a weekly video series that we like to call AdSolation. Where every Wednesday at 8pm, we would post a one minute video to our Instagram channel. This naturally coached our audience into getting excited to show up at our channel for the specific piece of content each week. People would actually reach out days before expressing their excitement for what they knew was to come. It helped us develop audience loyalty and connect with them on such a deeper level. We're now moving on to the next phase which is posting. You've put in the effort to get yourself and your audience all hyped up so now it's time to actually hit that button and share what you have created with the world. In this next short section, I'm going to cover two hot topics to help optimize your posts and that is hashtags and post times. Okay, let's dive into some posting tips and we're going to start things off with hashtags. There's a great debate about whether hashtags are worth using these days. And here at One Peak we believe that yes, you should be using them but you need to be using the right hashtags. Because A, they will help increase your engagement rates and B, they're going to make your content more discoverable. And who doesn't want their content to get more visibility? Let me break this down. If you attach a hashtag to your video, that video is going to appear under the hashtag result page where a user searches for that hashtag. To put it simply, your content has a better chance of being shown to an audience who is directly searching for it. This exposes you to a larger number of people who may not yet be following you, who are already interested in your niche, and also improves your chance of gaining new followers. As a general rule of thumb, I suggest using 4-8 hashtags max that are a mix of trending and more importantly, niche hashtags that are relevant to your video. Remember, a smaller amount of intentional hashtags will go a lot further than a large number of general hashtags. Avoid using hashtags like FyP or Summer, instead include ones that are specific and relate directly to the theme or goal of your video. So as an example, let's say I'm posting a video for a healthy taco recipe that I've created. Instead of using a hashtag like Healthy Food or Healthy Recipe, break it down even further using tags like Healthy Taco Recipe or Vegan Taco Recipe. Getting more granular increases the chance that the people who are searching for those hashtags will be more invested in your video, and hopefully spend more time watching it, which is going to up your engagement rate. As a quick activity, look back on your last 10 posts and come up with 4-8 hashtags you would now include based on what we have chatted about. This is such a great practice to get into for future posts as you grow as a creator. Next up is Post Times. So you've attached your hashtags to your video and now you're probably wondering when is the best time for me to post this thing. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I really don't want you to get too hung up on Post Times, especially when you're on TikTok. Yes, there is a way to give yourself a leg up by analyzing your audience analytics, but if your content tells a good enough story, the post time should not matter. Your content should be so good that it is reaching well beyond your current audience and those people just might be in a different time zone. But if you are the type of person that thrives on structure, you can dive into your insights and find the top 3 times of day that your audience is on the platform. Aim to post somewhere near those times, but don't beat yourself up on it if you're off by an hour or two. You also shouldn't be afraid to post more than one time a day. In fact, on TikTok, the more the merrier. As a general rule, just aim to leave 3-4 hours between each post because direct back-to-back posting has been known to be penalized by their AI. Okay, so the next phase is engaged. At this stage, you have manifested results, shared the amazing piece of content, so what's next? Well, hopefully you have mastered the art of storytelling and have released something that is so entertaining that people are starting to engage with it. I now want to speak about the importance of engagement rate and the engagement window. High engagement rate means that the potential reach of your brand is much greater, which will hopefully lead to more opportunities and happy clients. As a creator, it's important to understand what is considered a good engagement rate and set goals for yourself. On platforms like Instagram and TikTok, engagement is measured by a range of metrics, such as comments, shares, likes, saves, followers, mentions, watch time, click-throughs, and DMs. How to calculate this rate is by finding the total engagement on your piece of content divided by your total followers and then multiply that by 100. I know that's a lot of math and it does vary from platform to platform. Most social media experts agree that a good engagement rate on Instagram is somewhere between 1% and 5%, where on TikTok, it ranges between 4% and 18%. It's important to keep engagement rate in mind once you have already posted. Here's a quick tip to help boost each piece of content organically. Respond and reply frequently to comments, encourage conversations in the comment section, opt for niche hashtags for a higher chance of people investing in your content. Include a question or conversation starter in your caption to encourage people to converse and cross-post your content on different platforms. Now I want to talk about the engagement window. Don't be one of those people who post and then forget to vote it right away. Be as present as you can throughout what I like to call the engagement window, which is 3-5 days after posting. As we spoke about earlier in this course, you need to be continuously serving your online community and this includes engaging back when someone interacts with your content. Taking the time to write out a simple response to someone's comment can go further than you think. It can make people feel seen and heard, which is super important, especially if that person interacting with your content is there for the very first time. I believe that community is built in the comment section. Use this space to nurture your digital relationships and provide value for others if you can. Remember when I spoke earlier about the weekly video series we had here at One Peak? Well, every single video we posted would get hundreds of comments. And I made a point to block out a couple of hours in my day to respond to every single one of those comments. And guess what? Those people were more inclined to engage with our future content. I made them feel seen. And as a result, they felt a greater connection and loyalty to our brand. Remember, engagement is a two-way street. Moving on to the final phase, detachment. This phase is probably the hardest to master and one that took us years to actually understand the true value of. When you think about it, the whole idea of attachment might seem counterproductive. You might be thinking, so you want me to put all of this effort into creating a fantastic video, launch, engage with it, and then just let it all go? And yes, that's exactly what we are saying. When you have gone in the weeds with your content, it's easy to develop a strong attachment to what you have created. You have set high expectations and you expect brilliant results. You can spend an enormous amount of time over analyzing where you went right or where you went wrong, becoming obsessed with those numbers. But the fact of the matter is you can't put all of your eggs into one basket. The world of social media and content creation moves way too fast for that. Spend your time in the engagement window we spoke about and then move on. Your time is so much better spent thinking about the next big thing than being stuck in the what could have been space. Become okay with moving on from your creations so you have room to nurture new ideas. The creator space is always growing and evolving and you need to be able to pivot and hop on trends quickly if you need to. If you can find the perfect balance of quality and quantity, you will be well on your way to the career you have always dreamed of. There you have it, our four phase launch strategy. Hype Post engage and detach. We hope this gives you a new perspective as you head into your next launch and helps you keep the needle moving forward after your videos have been posted. In the next lesson, Glenn is going to chat about the importance of persistence. See you over there.
