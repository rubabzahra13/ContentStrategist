 Now that you've learned about the fundamentals of storytelling and script writing and have a story of your own, it's time for the most pivotal part of this entire course. It's time for the make or break moment that determines whether your content will pop or flop. It's time for the hook. Creating a powerful hook is the single most important skill you'll develop as a content creator. Even if you have the most valuable content in the world that lays out a bulletproof three-step guide to becoming a billionaire overnight, it won't matter if you don't have a strong hook. Because nobody will stick around long enough to cash in on your offer. So what is a hook? A hook is a tool we use to inform our audience what we're offering them in as little time as possible and with crystal clarity. Think about it as a simple sales transaction. You're offering your audience a product, your content or story, and exchange for currency. They're time. So they need to know that the product you're offering them is worth spending their time on. Usually viewers will make this decision within the first five seconds of a video on Instagram or TikTok and the first couple minutes of a feature film or after watching the trailer, which is a hook and another itself. So how do we make a good hook? The best way to create strong hooks is by getting the most interesting or important piece of your video to your audience in the first five seconds and doing so in a way that's entertaining but also easy to understand. Your hook should inform your viewer what the payoff will be for watching the video and create tension that they need to be resolved. When we create our hooks, we start by looking back at the value we're offering. Is it entertainment or education? Here's an example for each if you are making content for an audience of avid golfers. Example number one, education. Do you know what's in the middle of a golf ball that makes them so bouncy? Let's find out. Example number two, entertainment. If you play golf, you are one of these five people. These examples both let the audience know exactly what they'll be receiving if they watch the full video and offer a quick taste of that payoff to really get them invested. This process is something that you'll constantly refine as you learn from your audience and by using analytic tools within social media apps to see exactly where viewer stop watching. We'll cover more on this later but for now we're going to put what we just learned into action and break down some TikTok hooks together. Example number one, education. We've got about $100 worth of A&W so we can go tear it all apart and show you how we make a beautiful burger ad. I know it's like 7am but are you guys serving burgers yet? Can't we do? This was a TikTok that we made for A&W to show people how we created an ad for their products. The hook that we used was buying $100 worth of A&W and telling our audience we were going to go rip it all apart. That created curiosity for our audience to see how we took something from a mess to a beautiful finish video. Example number two, entertainment. When I woke up and saw Ryan Reynolds, like the movie star Ryan Reynolds comment on our video, I was like no, no way, I'm dreaming. But then I saw his wife play commented too. This hook creates so many questions for the viewer. They already know who Ryan Reynolds is so they're probably wondering what is the video? Why did he comment? Why did his wife comment? There's just so many questions that need to be answered and that they'll guaranteed stay to the end of the video to find out. Here are a few more hook examples to get your brain going. We lost control of our drown over a resort filled with people. This is my biggest nightmare. All right, Sansa, the last item on the Christmas Eve checklist. Here is how we turned our garage into a secret underground cave. Okay, now that we've given you our process and shown it in action, it's your turn. Take the next 20 minutes to come up with 5 to 10 different hooks for your story. When you've landed on the one that feels best, you're ready to bring your idea to life. But before that can happen, you might have to run it by a few people. And in the next lesson, Meg is going to teach you how to do that with confidence.
