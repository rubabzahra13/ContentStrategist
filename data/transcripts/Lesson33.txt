 Welcome to the DaVinci editing lesson. This is where I'm going to be teaching you everything you need to know about our workflow in DaVinci Resolve. So DaVinci Resolve is a program that we started using about a year ago and it has become my main workhorse when it comes to project editing. So we've edited everything from broadcast commercials to TikToks and Reels on this app. It's perfect for whether you're shooting on DSLR or phone and it's been used for movies like La La Land, Deadpool, Star Wars, the list goes on. So this is going to be crampacked with valuable information to make you the fastest and most efficient editor possible. So let's get into it. Now first off, if you don't have DaVinci on your computer yet, it's super easy. All you need to do is look up DaVinci download and it's going to come up right on the top here. You'll be able to find it right here. So download it, follow the instructions and it'll be super easy to get this going on your computer. Once that's downloaded, we're going to click on DaVinci Resolve to open it up. So the first thing you're going to see when you open it up is the DaVinci Project Manager window. This is basically where all your projects are going to live. If you're just opening it up for the first time, this is going to be completely empty. So we're just going to click on Untitled Project. Now in the lesson description, we included a folder of files. So what you're going to do now is go and download that folder. In that folder, we've included all of the clips that you need to follow along the music as well as DaVinci shortcuts. So the very first step, we're going to go into DaVinci. We're going to click this DaVinci Resolve in the top left. We're going to hit Keyboard Customization, hit the three dots in the top right hand corner of the screen and go Import Preset. Now you're going to find where you downloaded that folder and hit the FYP underscore DaVinci underscore shortcuts dot TXT. We're going to open that up and you're going to see it in the top right of the screen here. Basically what this does is just imports all of our custom keyboard shortcuts, which we'll be using throughout this tutorial. So it's important that you do this step first. Okay, so once you're in DaVinci, you're going to notice all of these icons along the bottom of the screen. So these are different work spaces and the ones that we're going to be using are Edit, which is this third one in Color and Deliver, which is exporting of your files. So let's start over in Edit. So I'm just going to walk you through this whole screen. On the bottom, you have the timeline. This is where you're going to be building out the structure of your video. The top left, this is your media pool. So this is where we're going to have all of the clips that we shot that we're editing from. Then on the right side here is going to be all of your effects. So let's just drop some clips in and I can start to explain this. So we're just going to open up the folder where we downloaded everything. Select all the files, drag and drop into the media pool. It's a pretty safe bet to hit Change so that everything matches the footage that you shot. Okay, so I hit Import and now everything is in the media pool here. So when I double click on one of these clips, it shows up right here. So this is where I can preview the files before I put them into my timeline. Okay, here is the first and one of the most important keyboard shortcuts that you're going to use. So when you double click on a clip and you hit Play, it's going to start playing the clip through. So that's right where I want it to start. So I'm going to hit the left arrow just to pull it back a few frames to right before he starts talking. So when I hit four, that's going to be the in point for the clip. So basically that's the start of the part that I want to use. So now I'm going to hit Play. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. I know it does. So I'm going to stop. That's the end of the clip. So now I'm going to hit five. Now when I hit six, this clip goes directly into the timeline at the bottom of the screen. So now you can see here. If you want to make this bigger, you can use this bar here. Or you can hold option and scroll up or down. Either way, it works great. You'll notice that there's big black bars on the left and right side of the video here. So because we're shooting vertical instead of horizontal, we just need to update the settings to match that. So in the very bottom right, there's a gear. We're going to click on that. And instead of 1920 by 1080, we're going to change this to 1080 by 1920. So this is standard vertical format for social media. So we're going to hit save and there we go. Perfect. So the very first thing we're going to do is go through these clips and pick out the parts that we actually want to use. So usually we'll have five or 10 takes for everything. I've only put the actual take that we ended up using into the folder just to make it a little bit easy and a little bit more organized. So we've got this video which starts it off. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. I know it does. So now we're just going to go through and do the four or five, six input output put into the timeline for every single clip. So this is the next clip that we want to use. I'm going to play. So I can tell he's just about to talk there. So I'm going to hit four. Hit space bar to play. The door handles are completely hidden. Hit space bar again to stop. So I'm going to hit five for the output and six drops it right into the timeline. So now I'm going to have Meg reacting to that. You can see I'll start to hit space rapidly to kind of get to the point that I want. I'm going to hit four because this is the endpoint space. Five and six drops it in. Hopefully you're starting to get the hang of it. Now we're going to double click on this shot. Same thing. I think I want to have his head turning here. So it's going to be for there. Time demands play. Five and six. Now keep in mind it's okay if you have a little bit at the beginning or end of these because we're going to be trimming it down later when we cut out all the walls for social media. Okay, so this is the next scene. Pull it back using the left arrow. Now four space. Oh, our gas prices are. Notice. It's going to stop it. Hit five and six to drop it in. Now we got to close up here of Meg saying that same line. So I'm going to drop this in because I think we'll end up cutting to this. It says it's going to take four hours. What do we do now? Five and six to drop it in. Double click on this one. Four. Five and six. Okay, I think this is our last shot here. You can also just drag along in the timeline bar to get to the spot that you want. So four. We've got a couple of things to work out. But can you make your car horn sound like a fart? And five and six to drop it in. Now we're going to be adding sound effects for this later so it doesn't matter that there was no fart sound effect. Okay, so I'm going to zoom out on the timeline and now we have the basic bones of our entire video laid out. So let's just watch this through a bit. So I think it makes me better than everyone. Of course not. I know it does. The door handles are completely hidden. How do I get in? So at this point in the project what we're going to do is hit command S. So this is going to save the project. We're going to type in the title. Tesla honest add hit save. It's always a good idea just to keep hitting command S whenever you think about it so that if you ever do have a crash, you'll have a recent save. So we haven't had any problems with DaVinci Resolve in the past but just a good habit to get into. Okay, so the next step is going to be trimming down this video so that it is as quick and snappy as possible. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this audio bar and I'm just going to drag it down this way I can see where all of the audio clips are. And that's going to make it a little bit easier just to trim out the dead space. So let's take it to the beginning hit space. So you can see there's just a moment there before you actually starts talking. So we're going to come to right before you start talking. Left arrow to come back. So now you're going to use the keyboard shortcut Q. So Q is called ripple delete and what it does is it takes everything from where your playhead is or where this red bar is. And it's going to delete everything behind it to the next cut. That might sound a little bit confusing but I'm going to explain that on a few more clips here. So let's take this second clip when we play it. Same thing. There's a couple frames there that we can cut out. So when I go over one two three to the right hit Q. You can see that deleted everything from where that red playhead is to the beginning of that clip. This is going to save you so much time because the alternative takes quite a while. So that pulls everything to the beginning of the clip but I'm going to show you how to ripple delete the end of the clip as well. So let's watch this through. So that's where I want it to end and it looks like we have a few extra frames on the end there. So when I hit E that's going to delete everything from where that red playhead is to the end of the clip. Perfect. All right now I'm going to fast forward and just go through and make this adjustment to all of the clips. Okay, perfect. So I cut everything off the beginnings and the ends of the clip. Now going through it again, I noticed a few things that we're going to want to do to speed up this video. So let's watch this part here. Oh, our gas prices are in. And notice. It says it's going to take four hours. It says it's going to take four hours. So we have a shot where we cut into May and we're going to actually cut to that the moment that we see Meg pop her head out of the window here. So same thing we're going to hit E and that's going to remove everything in front of that playhead. So now when we see your pop her head out of the window. It says it's going to take. We're going to cut that just a little bit earlier. It says it's going to take four hours. What do you do now? Perfect. Now I don't think we need the, what do we do now? I think the four hours is the punchline on this one. So we're going to cut it right after that. Four hours. So now we're going to hit E and that removes the end of the clip. Okay, so basically what we're doing now is we're going to try to cut this together so that it is as interesting as possible. And we can keep the watch time as high as possible. So let's watch through and try to think of any ways that we can do that. I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone. So I think we can have some b-roll here. He says, do I drive a Tesla? It'd be good to have a visual cue of driving a Tesla. So I have this included. So we're going to take this shot here and I only need the video part. So I'm going to click on that and I'm going to drag it in here on top of the clip of Khan. So let's watch through and see exactly where we want to put this. Do I drive a Tesla? So I think once he says Tesla, we can put that in. I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone. Of course not. So I think it's going to feel really good to put emphasis on to this point. So what we're going to do is we're going to hit W. What W does is it puts a cut through everything on your timeline. So now you can see that there's a cut between this part of the clip and this part of the clip. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to it. And in the top right, you can see transform tools. So this is where you can change things like zoom, the position of the clip, the rotation. And when you want to revert it back to the original, just hit this arrow, arrow, and arrow, and you're back. So what we're going to do here is we're just going to zoom in for emphasis. We're going to recent here his face using the position. And let's watch that back and see what we think. And everyone, of course not. I know it does. All right, that's perfect. So now we're going to go through and find any other spots like that where we can kind of increase the pacing of the shots. So let's space. How do I get in? Time demands playing. Oh, our gas prices on. Did notice. So that all felt pretty good for pacing. We're going to be going pretty quickly, but I think this shot here, we can do another jump in. Oh, our gas prices on. It also feels like it takes a little bit too long for him to get from the end of the line to the next line. So what we're going to do is we're going to go to. We're going to stop right after the line and we're going to hit W. And then we're going to go through just a little bit and we're going to hit Q. So we're going to be deleting that clip back to where you cut it. So let's have a watch. Here again. Oh, our gas prices on. Did notice. So right now this is what we call a jump cut. And for the most part, we try to stay away from this just because it feels a little bit jarring and uneasy. So you can see it's the same shot, but he just moves in it. Oh, our gas prices on. Did notice. Feels a little bit awkward. So what we're going to do is we're going to hit W again. We're going to hit this clip and we're going to do the same thing. We're going to zoom right in on it. Now this video was shot in 1920 by 1080 vertically. But you still have a lot of room to zoom in. So this is zoomed in almost double. But when you're watching on a phone, it still looks great as long as it's sharp. So now let's watch. So our gas prices on. Did notice. All right, that's feeling great. Let's give that another one. Oh, our gas prices on. Did notice. It says it's going to take four hours. Takes time to save the planet, baby. Yeah, sure. So I think I can trim that up a little bit more just to get that pacing a little quicker. If Q or E ever don't work for you, all you need to do is click outside of the clips here. Hit it and then it'll work. The reason that it's doing that is if you have a clip selected and you hit Q or E, it's only going to do it to that one clip. So try to always make sure that you're not selecting a clip when you're using the Q or E. Okay, we're going to hit command S again, keep saving as we go. And let's watch the end of the video. Yeah, sure. We've got a couple of kings to work out. But can you make your car horn sound like a fart? Now, this feels like just a little bit too long talking to camera. So we're going to try to find some B roll again to put in there. And I think this shot here is going to work great. So I'm going to hit four. And then I'm going to go to the end of the shot. Let's do that. Five. And rather than hitting six, I'm just going to take this little icon here and just drag the video portion of that clip into the timeline. The planet, baby. Yeah, sure. We've got a couple of kings to work out. Perfect. Now, I think we can get rid of this space here. So at the end of this line, we're going to hit W. Now we're going to go to the beginning of the next line, hit Q. I'm going to zoom in on the first clip here. Like this. So now when we watch it through, we got a couple of kings to work out. But can you make your car horn? We got rid of that space and it still feels like it's moving quickly and seamlessly. Next, I'm going to show you an editing trick that we use all the time. And it's called a J or an L cut. So basically what that means is we're going to have a clip that you can see while you start to hear the audio from the next clip. That might sound confusing, but I'm going to show you what I'm talking about. So if you find this clip here where Meg is sticking her head out the window. So the audio comes from this clip underneath. It says it's going to take, but I'm going to use the visuals from this clip for the beginning of it. This is just going to up the pacing a little bit and make it feel a little bit more seamless. I'll show you what I mean. So if we watch this through. It says it's going to take four hours. So it looks like she's actually talking at the beginning of that clip, but it is the audio from a different clip. So any time that you can use this just to speed things up, I always highly recommend it. Okay, this is feeling really good. So we're going to add some music to get the music for this. We went into TikTok and we screen recorded a song that we wanted to use. So I've included that in the folder here. So you can see we went into the recommended music. I hit screen record. If you don't know how to do this, you can give it a quick Google for your phone. It's super easy. And then I hit play on the song. And it just plays it all the way through. So I'm going to go for for this. And I'm just going to take the audio. I'm going to take that, put it into the timeline. And I'm just going to put it underneath the other speaking audio here. So first thing I can already tell that the music is going to be too loud. So when you click on an audio channel, you'll get the volume in the top right here. So we can decrease that. Let's try minus 12 and just see how this sounds. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. Still a little bit loud. Let's go minus 22. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. So I actually think I like this part of the song better. So I'm going to pause there. Just selecting this one clip. I'm going to hit W. So if you're selecting a clip and you hit W, it's only going to cut that one clip. So remember if you're not selecting a clip, it'll cut everything. If you're selecting a clip, it'll just cut the one. So now we're going to pull that song over. And now let's listen again using that part of the song. Do I have a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. I know what that does. The door handles are completely hidden. How do I get in? Time demands play. Okay, awesome. I think I can turn this down just a little bit more. It's still kind of competing with the vocals. We can also do this by turning the vocals up just a little bit. That should be about right. Okay, so now I'm going to add sound effects. There's a few spots that I think it's going to make sense. The first is the wink. I think it's nice to have a little chime on that. So let's watch through. Time demands play. Okay, so usually we would use a service called soundly, which is a paid membership. And it's as easy as just finding a sound. Listening to it. I guess it's more of a ding that I want. Let's try that. That's good. So with soundly, all you would do is take this, highlight it, and just drag it in. Now, if you don't want to do a membership program, which if you're only using it once in a while, I probably wouldn't want to either. There is a website called free sound. So this is all completely royalty free. Use it for anything sound. So once you sign up, you can search for anything you want. I'm going to search for ding. Let's see what we get. Yeah, that's about right. So let's click into it. And I'm going to hit download. I'm going to save it to the folder that everything else is in. This is nice. So the down the road, if you ever have to open this project, again, everything lives in the same folder. Now, I just find it and drop it in. So I'm going to zoom right in with this bar. And let's see what we think. Oh, our guy. Great. Just a little bit loud. Let's try negative 15. Oh, our gas prices are perfect. Notice it says it's going to take four hours. Take time to save the planet, baby. Yeah. Now let's do the audio for the end of the video, because this is a big one. But can you make your car, who sound like a fart? So this is one of the weird things that we have to do in our job. I'm going to look up fart sounds. All right, this is super gross. So I'm just going to pick one. And I'll just show you what I found, because these are a lot worse than I expected. All right. So I strongly don't recommend going through fart sounds in free sound. They're very, very authentic. But I'll drop one in that I think is going to do the job. Let's have a listen. Let's pull that over to when he pushes the horn. Perfect. Okay, I'm going to hit W. And I'm going to get rid of all the clips at the end here. Okay, so this is a part where I'll start watching the video through multiple times. And just see if there's anything that I can be adding, changing, tightening up. So let's do that right now. And I'll stop it if I see anything that I think can be changed. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes it? So you can see there's a little flash of a frame there. So I'm just going to zoom right in. And if you want to make a clip shorter, all you have to do is hover over the left side of the clip, click and drag over to the right. Perfect. I'm going to zoom back out so I can see, drag to the beginning, and let's watch again. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. I know it does. The door handles are completely hidden. How do I get it? Looks like that can be tightened up just a little bit. So I'm going to go right to the end of this. Now, if you already have music and sound, something that you'll want to do when you're doing this final editing is lock the music using this lock right here. So that way, when you hit E and you delete the end of a track, it's not also deleting the music. This can be a massive pain if you get to the end of your project and realize that the music has actually been cut up and moved around. So let's keep watching. The door handles are completely hidden. How do I get in? Time to mansplain. Oh, our gas prices are? Did notice. It says it's going to take four hours. It takes time to save the planet, baby. Yeah, sure. We got it. So we got a little bit of a wink at the end there. I don't think we need it just because we have the other wink. So I'm going to take this shot and I'm going to drag it over. So let's watch again. It takes time to save the planet, baby. Yeah, sure. We got a couple of kings. There's a bit of a space there between, yeah, sure. And we've got a couple of kings. So because we have B-roll over top of this one, we can delete that and we don't have to change the shot at all because it's completely hidden. So I hit W to make a cut in the track. I'm going to go to where I want to cut back to you. Hit Q and delete everything backwards. And how we can drag this B-roll shot back over top. And let's try that. It takes time to save the planet, baby. Yeah, sure. We've got a couple of kings to work out. But can you make your car, Lauren? Sound like a fart. Ah. Okay, so the ending there, it's a little bit too long on the same shot. So what I want it to do is actually zoom in on his face. So we're going to play through your car, Lauren. Sound like a fart. So right from here, I want it to start zooming in. So this is where we get into keyframes. And I'm going to show you how a keyframe works. Basically, what we're going to do is in the top right of this screen, we're going to hit this little triangle here. Click it. Now you've created a keyframe. We're going to hit another one for position. So now what we're going to do is go to the end of the clip. And we're going to zoom in and change the position. So that just created two new keyframes with those edits. So what's going to happen is the image is going to change from the first keyframe to the second keyframe in whatever amount of time you've set. If you want to see where your keyframes are, just click on this little triangle in the far right hand corner of your clip. And you can see these are your keyframes. So this is fully zoomed out. This is fully zoomed in. It actually looks like there's a little bit of a black bar there. So what we're going to do is just click on this right arrow. And that takes us right to that keyframe. And we're just going to position it over a little bit just so that we don't get any of that black line. So now you can see it just does a nice, slow, smooth zoom in. You can do this anytime you want if you want to do a zoom instead of a cut for emphasis. Okay, so at this point we're going to hit unlock. And I'm going to pull over the right side of this clip. Now let's zoom out. So as you can see, getting it to this point took less than half an hour. And that's while I'm walking through it. So these edits can be done in like 20 minutes to get it to this point. As long as you have a really solid idea before you get into the edit of how the video is going to flow. It also helps a lot if you know what the music's like. If you know how quick you want the pacing because you can be doing that all as you go. Now we used a couple of bureau shots in here. But a lot of the time when we do videos will add so much more bureau just to have something to cut away too so that it doesn't feel like you're on somebody's face for too long. And just to give a little bit more context to what's actually happening in the video. Now let's get into exporting your final video. So if you go to the end of the video here and then zoom right in, you're going to hit oh. So what oh is the out point. So that's where you want the end of your video to be. Now as you can see by going to the end of your video and hitting oh. DaVinci exported one extra frame. I don't know why it does this. It drives me crazy and you'll see on TikTok who uses DaVinci because a lot of the time they don't know this trick. Just hit the left arrow over one so that you're one frame back from the very end. Hit oh again. And then it'll export to the very end of your video without giving you one black frame. So now we're going to go into the deliver tab which is where we're going to do all of our export settings. So hit that. We're going to go H.264 master. Put in your file name for us Tesla honest ad. Browse you can either put this into one folder that has all of your final videos. That's usually what I do or you can put it into the folder that has all of the files for this project. So pick which one you like better and make sure it's exporting in 1080 by 1920 because it's a vertical video. Hit add to render queue and render all. And that's it. Now you have a finished file that is ready to send to your phone and upload to Reels TikTok wherever it's going to go. Hope you guys love this lesson. I'm going to be diving further into DaVinci with more editing lessons after this. But this is our basic workflow for how we edit through social media videos as quickly as possible. Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next one. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. I know it does. The door handles are completely hidden. How do I get in? Time demands playing. Oh, our gas price is hard? Did not notice. It says it's going to take four hours. Takes time to save the planet, baby. Yeah, sure. We've got a couple of kings to work out. But can you make your car horn? Sound like a fart?
