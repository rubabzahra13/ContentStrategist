 In this lesson, I'm going to share a bunch of quick tips to start shooting better quality footage using your iPhone. This tool in our pocket really has so much to offer, and it is all you need to kickstart your career as a content creator. I want to begin by acknowledging that phone footage has come a long way since the first iPhone 3. It was great for its time in 2008, but the quality was just super low res. And in my opinion, not really acceptable to create videos to market to a product or business. With today's iPhone technology, we can shoot 4K footage, toggle between wide and zoom lenses, and capture some super crispy audio. The quality of footage that your phone can produce is crazy. But I'm here to share a few simple tips that will help improve that quality even further and take your phone footage to the next level. I want to begin by saying that this lesson is specific to iPhone, but if you have an Android or any other type of device, it can be transferable. The difference will just be in the settings. Let's do it. Number one, record in your camera app. My first big tip that I want you to consider is to always shoot your content using the camera app that's built into your phone. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok give you the option to film your content directly in their apps, which is mostly because they want you to spend as much time as possible in the app. But this convenient way of filming isn't necessarily the best way. You should avoid using the cameras provided in the app because taking this route comes with two challenges. Challenge number one is the quality. Trust me on this, the quality is going to be so much better when you film directly on your phone and save the clips to your camera roll. To put it simply, the cameras provided in the apps like Instagram and TikTok are capturing the content at a lower resolution. When using your phone's built-in camera, you also have the ability to choose different camera modes and adjust exposure, which can make a huge difference. And I will get more into this later in this lesson. The second challenge is app bugs. There is nothing worse than filming a TikTok in the app and then your app crashes and you lose everything you've just created. You've probably been there and it is not a fun time and it can be really frustrating. Using your camera built into your phone is a safer option and avoids running into potential app bugs, which could lose all of your hard creative work. My next quick recording tip is to always try to shoot your videos using the rear camera on your phone instead of the front selfie cam. The rear camera quality is noticeably better and again gives you more flexibility in the settings. Recording this way allows you to adjust exposure for a better lit shot and also gives you wide and zoom lens perspectives to utilize if you want to. If you find it easier, set up a tripod so you can capture that selfie style footage using your rear camera. My next tip is to get your footage as stable as possible when shooting on a phone. And speaking of tripods, when it comes to stabilizing your phone footage, nothing is going to be a tripod and a phone mount. This is a great setup if you are sharing a story talking to camera, interviewing someone or working fun transitions into your videos. There are a ton of different setups that you can purchase for this, but we have added a couple of our favorite options in this lessons description for you to take a look at. Now if you need to move around while you're shooting and are looking for that buttery smooth footage, consider investing in a phone gimbal. These do take a little bit of time to get used to, but we would definitely suggest giving it a try, especially if you're one day wanting to make the switch over to a DSLR camera setup. Again, we have added a good option in the lesson description so you can take a look at that if you want to. The newest iPhones do have built-in optical image stabilization, which makes shooting decent handheld footage fairly easy. I'd say we use the handheld approach the majority of the time when shooting on an iPhone since it's the easiest and the most successful. Nailing that stable handheld footage can take some practice though, but you're going to want to start by following these three tips. Keep the phone close to your body when recording. Rest your elbows on a sturdy object nearby if you need to, and use your body to absorb any bounces or shakes. And remember practice makes perfect. Of course there might be instances when you are looking to create a more motivated, raw, shaky look, so stabilization isn't super necessary. And in those cases, a looser handheld approach with your iPhone is a great way to achieve it. Find natural light. If you are shooting with your phone on the fly, one of the biggest ways that you can enhance the look of your videos is to shoot with natural light in mind. A simple shift in your shoulders can really make all the difference here. If you are speaking to camera, make sure there's even natural light across your face, which can be achieved as simply as getting closer to a window or a light source. Avoid backlighting your shots when you can, unless you are going for that specific aesthetic. And if you choose a location with poor lighting, there is a good chance your footage is going to come out muddy or grainy. I'd also suggest planning any of your outdoor shoots around gold an hour if you can, which is an hour after the sun rises and an hour before the sun sets. This will naturally provide more even lighting and will help you avoid the washed out or direct sunlight look. Number 5. Adjust Exposure One feature the iPhone has is that it will automatically focus and expose your shots for you. Now this can be a great function when you want to take a quick photo, but when you're shooting a video of a moving subject, it can make things a little complicated. Unfortunately, the iPhone tends to just keep adjusting and refocusing as a record, which can lead to jittery looking footage and abrupt lighting changes halfway through your shot. But here's the good news. You can lock and adjust exposure before you hit record by using the little sun displayed on your screen. All you have to do is tap your screen to focus and then scroll the little sun icon until you get the exposure you are looking for. Once you've achieved that look, you're going to tap and hold the yellow focus and expose your box to lock in those settings. Test this out when you're filming your next video and hopefully this will help you get more control when it comes to exposure. Number 6. Utilize the Grid Composition is what your camera sees and also what your audience sees. Taking the extra moment to make sure your shot is correctly framed is going to make a world of a difference to the end result. If you're not sure how to correctly compose a nice shot, you can start by using your iPhone's built-in grid and frame the shot using the rule of thirds. The basic concept of the rule of thirds is that your shot will look better to the viewer if you put points of interest on the thirds of your frame. You can envision these points by breaking up your screen into nine blocks, three sections vertically and three sections horizontally. The rule of thirds creates a natural feeling of balance and gives context which are both helpful for your viewer. We are going to go over this more in-depth in the next lesson about composition and rules of thirds but turning your phones grid on is a great place to start. So you're going to go to your settings, hit camera and then toggle grid to turn the function on. Now following the rule of thirds line up your subject so they fall neatly on an intersecting line. If you are capturing a shot of faces, make sure their eyes are intersecting with the top line. Keep this tip in mind whenever you are trying to bring attention to a subject or when you are filming an interview. I promise it is going to be super helpful. Number seven, leave space. If you are creating content for Instagram Reels or TikTok, you are probably going to be adding text or stickers to help you tell your story. If this is the case, make sure to leave room at the top or the bottom and the sides of the frame to avoid spilling over into the apps real estate. Nothing throws off a viewer more than when they are trying to read a text block covered in unwanted icons. A great rule of thumb is to leave a little extra headroom and a little extra footroom while you are filming. So you have the ability to add additional components to the video. Once this becomes a habit, you won't even have to think about it and you'll be thanking yourself once you dive into the edit. Number eight, explore shooting modes. Your iPhone also has a number of different shooting modes built into the camera that you can experiment with to get more creative. I'd say you will use your phone's regular video mode 95% of the time, but it's good to at least explore the others to see if there's a creative way to work them into your content. Slow motion mode can be used when you want to create that epic vibe. Try using it when doing a pan of your hero subject or when you want to see one of your action shots slowed down. The cinematic mode found on newer iPhones recreates the look of high-end cameras by separating your subject with a subtle blur. We suggest trying this mode out when you're capturing your product beauty shots or when filming interviews. Time lapse mode is great for when you want to share how something has come together over a period of time. We like to use this mode for our behind-the-scenes videos to show the entire filming process in record time. As a little exercise, I suggest testing out each mode on your phone during your next shoot to see what you can create. Who knows, maybe you'll spark some fun new content ideas. Number nine, move, don't zoom. This is a quick simple tip that is mostly just a bad habit that you need to kick. I want you to vow to never again zoom in when you are shooting videos on your phone unless it's for dramatic effect. Put those pincher fingers away for good. Instead, move closer to your subject. The zoom feature is going to massively affect the quality your camera is able to capture and leave your content looking really grainy. Remember, move, don't zoom. Number 10, use an external mic. I want to start this tip off by saying yes, you can use the microphone built into your phone to record your audio. But if you want to take that audio to the next level, using an external mic is going to be your best friend. That's because you can get this mic much closer to the subject you are filming without being in frame. This is going to help deal with any unwanted background noise or muffled audio due to your subject being too far away. You could honestly use a second phone for this if you have one handy. But there are also a few other options that we have shared in the lesson description for you. And here's a bonus tip. You're also going to want to shoot all of your content using the most compatible mode. It can be found here in the settings and you're going to want to turn this on because it's going to make your editing life so much easier. I hope you found these tips useful and you were well on your way to creating better quality footage using your iPhone. I am a firm believer that you can create an incredible career as a creator with just this tool in your pocket and never need to make the step to the DSLR if you don't want to. It all comes down to the story you are sharing and making that story easily consumable by your audience. All right, let's move on to the next lesson where we are going to dive into editing software.
