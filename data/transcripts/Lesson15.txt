 Now that you've adopted positive core beliefs, set powerful goals, and have begun to develop daily habits, you are ready to create content that people care about. And that all starts by offering value. In this lesson, we're going to be learning the definition of value as it relates to content creation. The reason this is such an important lesson is that the social media landscape has changed drastically in recent years. Not only the way the apps look and function, but also in the way we share and the way that we consume content. Algorithms are beginning to serve content to specific audiences based on merit, which means that even if you have zero following, your video can receive hundreds of millions of views. A viral video is no longer just up to chance. You can discover how to create and recreate videos with millions of views just by understanding this one key element. What is the value? One of the main reasons content flops is that creators start thinking of themselves. How many views can I get? What new trend will make me go viral? How will this video make me look? However, in order to create content that your audience truly cares about and is excited to engage with, you have to put them first. It won't be the quick and easy viral video that you're hoping for. It's going to take work and it's going to take dedication, but it will also create a real relationship with your following. One that will last long beyond the next TikTok trend. Think about the content that you consume and what you share with your friends. What makes you share it? Chances are you found some kind of helpful information that you could use in the future or you were somehow moved emotionally. Either way, it was ultimately about what you the viewer got out of it. So that's where we need to start. By making sure everybody watching your video will be able to get something for themselves out of it. A great rule of thumb for this is the 90 10 equation. 90% of the content you produce should be specifically created with the viewer in mind. And only 10% should be about you or your product. Here's one last example to put this into perspective. Imagine you've just moved to New York City. It's your first Friday evening and you've just put on your very best outfit to attend a cocktail party and meet some new friends. As you arrive, you're greeted by a stranger with a dazzling smile. Before introductions are even made, they go on to tell you about how much their new outfit costs them, what kind of supercar they drive, and then top it all off by trying to sell you on their company's new fat loss supplement. At this very moment, another New Yorker hands you your favorite cocktail and compliments your fantastic fashion sense before offering to answer all of your questions about the big apple. Who in this scenario would you rather spend the rest of your evening with? Chances are it's going to be that second stranger. The one who genuinely cared. Social media is just another cocktail party. And you only get one first impression so you need to make a count. Now, let's reframe our approach from selfish to selfless. How can the content I produce positively affect someone's day? Am I truly helping people with this video? What can I do to ensure my audience feels appreciated? These are the types of questions that you should be asking as you've been conceptualizing. But we're going to simplify this process even further to ensure everything you create offers true value to your audience. There are two key indicators that we use here at One Peak to measure value and that's entertainment and education. Ultimately, no matter what type of content you produce, the sole purpose should be to either make somebody feel a certain emotion or teach them a valuable lesson. The best case scenario is being able to do both at the same time. So the first step in conceptualization is determining which category your content is going to fall into. Let's start with education. An educational piece of content provides information to help improve someone's life or solve a problem that they have. Here's an example. Thomas Edison had a secret for coming up with creative ideas and it's something I use almost every day. Let me explain. What he discovered was all of his best ideas came the moment before he fell asleep. But in the morning, he forgot what they were. So what he would do is take a heavy object and the moment before he fell asleep, the object would fall out of his hand, waking him up so that he could write down his big breakthrough. Since then, studies have been down to see if he was onto something. What they discovered is the moment before you fall asleep, your brain waves change to a more dreamlike state that actually works a lot better for problem solving and creative thinking. With this in mind, every night when I fall asleep, I try to think of something that I need a creative solution to you, which is usually a video concept. It's how I've had all of my best ideas and when I think of something, I just write it in my notes on the phone instead of having to light an oil lamp. And now entertainment, the purpose of these videos is pretty obvious to entertain. You may have noticed that the burgers you get here never look quite as good as the ads. What the f***? So we're vowing to change that. You're going to start making real quality food? No, that would be expensive. We're going to start taking f*** your photos. Can you make it look? Works. Fast food. It took 30 seconds. What do you expect? And the best case scenario, you're able to do both. Three, two, one. Today we're making a video, turning fruits for apps into dirt. And here comes the star of the show. Lo-me. So this beautiful machine right here takes food waste and it turns into dirt. And we're going to show that by pushing through a mound of food waste. I'm just working on prepping the food scraps. Having it raise up, turn into a food cyclone. Food scraps, puppets. And Guardian Levyosa, my dear. Which goes into the little lo-me and then first into dirt. My kind of vision is going to look like the pelagia of a mosque. Ready? Yeah. Now that you understand what value is and how to determine the value based on education and entertainment, it's time for an exercise. In the lesson description, you'll find two simple questions. Try to come up with as many answers as you can because each answer can turn into a future piece of content. The first question is, what do you want your audience to learn about your product or brand? And next, how do you want me to feel when they watch your video? Right out at least five in each of those categories. To help you out, we'll use one of our recent clients, the hearing loss clinic as an example. So what do you want your audience to learn about your product or brand? First and foremost, the hearing loss clinic can improve your hearing, which means they can improve your quality of life. It will make you more confident, it will minimize misunderstandings. Without them, there may have been missed opportunities. And the next question, how do you want them to feel when they watch your video? Because of the stigma around hearing loss, we want this video to feel approachable. We want the audience to feel happy, excited, surprised, and trusting. Okay, now it's your turn. When you're done with this exercise, we'll be using the info you've written down to help guide us through the next phase, which is creative research. Get ready to do some digging.
