 Ad engagement is an incredibly important and often overlooked tool to both get a better return from your ads and inform future campaigns. The comment section is almost always the first place that someone goes if they have feelings of skepticism or unanswered questions and it's your job to make sure that what they see when they get there reinforces their decision to buy from you. Which is what we'll be covering in this lesson. The comment section of your ad is important for three reasons. Number one, it's the first place that a viewer will look if they're not sure about you or your product. You can have all the social proof in the world, but your potential customers are going to scroll the comment section to find out what people actually think. Number two, the comment section will inform your future ads. If every second comment is saying that your price is ridiculous, you need to find a way to justify your price in your ads. And number three, a healthy comment section tells the algorithm that people like your ad and it's going to serve it to better leads for cheaper. So how do we get the most out of our comment section? Even the best ads leave people with unanswered questions or objections and they'll be going to the comment section to see if anyone else is already talking about it. While you do have the ability to hide negative comments, you also have the ability to reply to them and knock down their objections. On the ads for our TikTok and Reels creator course, people would comment things like, if you can get millions of views, why are you running ads? Rather than spiral or delete the comment, I would get back with something educating them on how there's a time and a place for both ads and organic content. And while we do have millions of organic views, ads allow us to be more direct with our marketing. I would also tell them that the algorithm is incredible for targeting people who are most likely to buy the product, not just consume the content. It didn't really matter whether the person who wrote the original comment reads it and changes their mind. Those responses are for the thousands of people who see the ad and are thinking the exact same thing. This is also an opportunity to inject your brand voice in a place where people aren't expecting it. The ultimate goal is for people to trust you. So if your responses in the comments are funny, sincere, or intelligent, you're building trust both with the person you're replying to and anyone who reads the comments in the future. While this amount of care and attention likely won't be sustainable for a business owner as the company scales, just like customer service, it's important to make sure it's somebody's responsibility to keep the comment section of your ad's healthy. What I want you to do is separate your comments into three categories. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Good comments are obviously the most fun to respond to. If someone's leaving a testimonial, prays for the quality of the ad, or just engagement with the ad itself, let your personality shine through in the way that you respond, or ask questions encouraging a conversation. This will help people to realize that there are real humans behind the ad and the brand. Often, we'll include elements within the ad to draw out as many good comments as possible, because like I said earlier, the more engagement an ad has, the better your ad will rank and the more good traffic you'll be getting for cheaper. You can do this by including a fun element of controversy within your ad. An example of this is an ad we created where Meg is covering macaroni in ketchup before giving it to me. She never mentions it in the ad, but we've gotten literally hundreds of comments with people calling it out and laughing about it. These comments aren't negative, it's not like they think less of us or a product because of it, but it starts a conversation. Another example is a video where we say that people's attention spans are like goldfish, and Meg is holding up a bowl with a clownfish in it. It's a tiny detail, but it was enough to get people's attention and give them something to talk about in the comments. Another type of good comment is a friendly objection. People who are genuinely curious about your product and have questions. These are my personal favorite because they're usually saying things that everyone is thinking and your reply can help to answer everybody's question. Spend the most time with these because they'll have the biggest impact on conversions and make sure to save your answers in a document for future reference. Because on different ads, you can copy and paste the same answer for the same question or just change it a little bit to fit the question that's asked. Next are the bad comments. People who want to rudely express their thoughts or skepticism in your product or add. There are two ways to handle these. The best case scenario is treating them the same as the friendly objection and helping the person to overcome their objection or at least kill them with kindness. You'll get a lot of credibility from potential customers if they see someone going off in the comments and you're handling them with respect and compassion. Especially if you can make them look like a child in the process. An example of this for us was a student who was angry because they took our social media course and their content wasn't blowing up. Rather than hide the comment or retaliate, I took a few minutes to look through their channel and gave them some feedback on what they could do better. The conversation took a quick turn. They apologized and they shared all of the things that they loved about the course. A lot of the time people just want to be heard and that's why they leave nasty comments. So giving them just a little bit of love goes a long way. Alternatively, you can handle these comments by simply hiding them. Remember that in most cases these are deeply...
