 In this next lesson, I'm going to be breaking down an ad that has driven several million dollars in revenue for our organic content creation course over the past few months. This is a hero ad in the relatable spokesperson format and it's right down the middle of the edutainment scale. This ad combines several of the ad types that we've talked about and breaks down as many objections as possible in an engaging way. I'll also be including a link to watch the full ad in the lesson description so you can see how each scene we break down flows seamlessly together. Here's a bit of backstory. When we started running ads to our product, the comment section was a bit mixed. There was a lot of people sharing skepticism and objections as well as a ton of trolls. We kept creating new ads, refining based on the comment section to make them better and better. The ad I'm sharing with you in this lesson is the first one that had a clean comment section. And by that I mean no skepticism, no objections, and only the unavoidable spam trolls. You know the ones. All with ads is to keep refining until you can get to a point to where your comment section is filled with nothing but positivity. So let's break down.
