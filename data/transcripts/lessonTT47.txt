 Now that you've learned one of the most valuable skills on planet earth, how to create a converting ad, next we're going to cover how to make sure those ads stay dialed so you can get the most longevity and bang for your buck. Creating ads is one thing, but making sure that they continue to perform for you is a whole other job in itself. What we don't want to do is spend a ton of valuable time creating what we think is a slam-dunk ad, and then when it doesn't perform exactly how you expect, immediately write it off and pull the plug. We're not going to do that here. Sometimes just the tiniest change can make a massive impact. We do this a lot with our own ads. We'll take one ad shoot and end up with 10 different variations of that ad when all is said and done. For one of our campaigns, those videos collectively have been able to receive over a million dollars in ad spend. So in this next module, we're going to walk through how to measure your ad performance and when or if to pivot. The process of making strategic creative iterations using your ad's analytics, the importance of the comment section and how to engage with intention and how to use those comments to create future ads that can make a really big impact.
