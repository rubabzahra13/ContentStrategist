 In this lesson, I'm going to give you three key principles we use to create high converting copy, as well as a guide for you to follow when doing long form copy. This seven step guide applies whether you're writing the script for a landing page video, the body copy, and even things like ad scripts or your emails. So let's get right into it. Principle number one is keep it concise. As Kevin Malone from the office would say, why use many word when few word do? Your goal with sales copy is to convince someone your product is worth their hard earned time and dollars in the fewest characters possible. Removing one unnecessary word in your header offer could have an impact on performance. There might be one sentence in your sales copy that either confuses people or borrows them. And removing it could be the difference between being profitable or not being profitable. Principle number two is that relatability is king. People don't buy because they understand what you're selling. They buy because they feel understood. If you can make your copy feel like it was written by a friend instead of a corporation, you'll keep their interest. You can do this by bringing yourself to their level. Show them that you used to be in their shoes and struggled with the problem that they're facing that your product solves. That could be anything from getting more views on social media to finding a t-shirt that fits just right. You can also add relatability through humor. For example, instead of saying, our course is two hours and everyone has time for that. We've included relatability by saying, you can binge it in two hours. That's like two episodes of Love is Blind and admit it. You crush that on a casual Tuesday. Principle three is you need to be honest. But you can't be honest. This one speaks for itself. Never lie, but also don't hold back when you're talking about what your product is capable of and the impact it can have in people's lives. Next, let's get into a guide that you can follow for your long-form copy. This can live in the block on your landing page, in the script for your landing page video, or even as a hero ad that could run to sell your product. First is the call out hook. This is where you address the problem the viewer is facing and share that you have the solution. This is meant to grab their attention, create curiosity, and give them a reason to read right until the end. I'll use the example of the copy on the landing page for this course. If you're looking for something that you can do in 30 minutes that could literally add millions to your business, you're in the right place. This applies to anything. Let's say you're selling a candle. It could be if you've ever walked in your door and noticed a mysterious, funky smell waiting for you, I have something you need to hear. Next is the credibility and relatability. Show the customer that you used to be in their shoes and you shared their struggles. The fastest way to gain their trust is to make them see themselves in you. Let's keep it going with the candle example. It could be, I used to be there too. Every time I got home, I didn't know if I was smelling wet dog last night's dinner or my kids' soccer cleats from last Tuesday. Next is the origin story of the solution. Now you're going to talk about how you created or discovered the solution that you're offering to people. Remember, keep it as concise as possible. But if the story that led to your product is riveting, you can expand on it so people understand where it came from. For example, it could be, all I wanted was for my house to smell like a luxury hotel. And that's when it hit me. I went to every luxury hotel in the world to discover their secret to a luxurious smelling lobby. I put everything I learned into this candle. Next up is the impact it had in your life. This is pretty straightforward. For the candle example, you could talk about how friends started asking to come over more often, how your stress levels went down, or how you impressed your boss that showed up for a surprise visit. After that is the impact it's had in other people's lives, also known as social proof. Although it's great that it worked for you, you're obviously biased. Of course you think your product is the shit, so how did it go for other people? Here you could talk about how your friend used the candle and her boyfriend finally moved in. You get the idea. Remember, you need to be honest, but you don't need to be modest. After that is the big hairy objection busters. At this point in your copy, people should understand exactly what your product is, but they probably have at least one reason that they're not ready to buy just yet. This is where you can knock down as many of those objections as you think you need to. These can be things like price, effort, time, fear of your product breaking, or not working, you get the idea. You want to break down these objections quickly, and with relatability if possible. This could be things like the love is blind time objection buster I mentioned earlier, for a money back guarantee if price or quality is an objection. For this course, I thought an objection would be that our landing page looks bad. So have we down the page, I wrote? I know what you're thinking. This landing page looks like shit. And you're absolutely right. So why are you still reading it? This shatters the objection that the landing page won't work because it doesn't look good. Finally, it's time to talk about what you'll get. This is where you outline the key features of the product and what people are going to get when they buy. Just this breakdown as exciting and concise as possible. If they've read this far, they're interested in the offer, so you need to drive it home. So to recap, the seven step copywriting guide goes like this. The call out hook, credibility and relatability, the origin story of the solution, the impact it had in your life, the impact it's had in other people's lives, big hairy objection busters, and finally, what you'll get. And if you get those steps right following our three key principles, you should be left with copy that leaves people ready to buy whatever it is you're selling. Now let's take that copywriting guide and apply it to our first landing page example of this course, the digital product.
