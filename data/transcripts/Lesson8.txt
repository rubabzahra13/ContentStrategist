 Welcome to the Find Your Peak Content Creator Course. We are so unbelievably excited to share with you all the things we wish we knew years ago when we were starting on the content creation journey. But before we do, we want to share a little bit about ourselves. At its core, One Peak is a video production company run by three creative entrepreneurs. Over the years, we've done everything from national broadcast campaigns abroad to influencer content creation and we've really created our dream job, learning everything along the way. In 2019, we were running a successful creative agency, bringing the concepts and visions of global brands to life. While it was fun, we all had big, ambitious ideas of our own that we wanted to create. So we set a goal. Within one year, we wanted to be creating only our own ideas that we were fired up about. And we wanted to make six figures from a single video. We also wanted to have an impact in people's lives. Shortly after that, COVID hit and forced us to cancel everything in our calendars. Without access to talent or locations, it felt like there was nothing we could do. We started thinking back to our goal and decided to take the world shining down as an opportunity. We challenged ourselves to create a one minute video from start to finish every day for 30 days. We would use the locations we had available and ourselves as talent. This taught us so much about getting uncomfortable and becoming more efficient with brainstorming, shooting and editing. The campaign was wildly successful with viral videos that got us in the news, millions of views, celebrity endorsements, and caught the eye of thousands of brands. Since then, we've been so fortunate to be able to pick and choose the projects we take on. Whether it's an idea we wanted to see come to life, creating for luxury resorts, or bringing our style and vision to national brands. But out of this journey to create a freedom came something we didn't expect. Creatives and people who reminded us of ourselves a few years ago started reaching out for advice, wanting to learn from our wins and our mistakes. Teaching became such a huge source of fulfillment in our lives that we wanted to find a way to share our lessons with more people at once. Which brings you up to speed with the Find You Peak content creator course. This course is designed to help bring the efficiency, creative thinking, and execution skills that helped us achieve our goal and get us to where we are today. I'm so unbelievably excited for you to be on this path because if you follow the advice we lay out, you're not far from a career that will be more fun and more rewarding than you can possibly imagine.
