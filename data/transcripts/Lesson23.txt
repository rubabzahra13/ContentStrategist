 Welcome back. In this lesson, I'm going to show you the fundamentals of shooting content that applies whether you're creating videos on your phone, a DSLR, or a cinema camera. This will cover the types of shots you'll be using and what they will convey as well as transitions and a few fundamentals for framing. The way you move the camera and frame a shot makes a huge difference on the way that people experience what you're shooting. If you're watching a movie with the sound off, there's a good chance you'll be able to tell the genre of the movie, who the hero is, or how the director wants you to feel by the camera movements and framing alone. This is as true for big budget blockbuster movies as it is for phone videos of your dog. It's important to learn these video fundamentals while you're planning your shoot because this is information that you'll want to include in your storyboard and shot list, which we'll get into later in this module. Let's get into the three main types of shots that are the building blocks of video creation. The wide establishing shot is used to give context on where your story is taking place. If you're watching Star Wars, they'll always show a big wide shot of the spaceship before jumping to a tight of Darth Vader. This is also true for a lot of content. If you're creating a video at the Grand Canyon, you'll want to include a big wide shot so that the viewer can understand where you are. Traditionally, these shots will go at the beginning of a video, so that viewers can start off a story with context on where they are. But these shots are also a good palette cleanser if you're jumping from one area to another. So people can see that the location has changed. The wider you go, the more you make a landscape feel vast and open. This is typically called an ultra wide shot, which will also make your subject look smaller and more insignificant. The medium. These are the bread and butter of all video production. A medium shot is most common for showing dialogue, emotion, and it's what you get when you just hold your phone up in front of you. Because of that, a common mistake that people make is overusing the medium shot. If you put two similar medium shots in a row, it's what's called a jump cut. This can be done on purpose for quick cut interviews or to show time passing, but used without intention, a jump cut can feel jarring and uncomfortable. If something isn't quite right in your video, consider mixing it up. The tight shot. The tight shot or close up is used to direct people's attention to specific subjects or objects. An obvious example of this is in a brand partnership. If you have a wide of your model using a product next to a fire, it's going to make sense to do a nice, slow, sexy tight on the product. Remember, the viewer's attention will go wherever you want it to go to, and the tight shots allow you to get very specific on what you want them to notice. Sequence. A sequence is the order of the shots that I just listed. This will be important when you get into creating your storyboard and shot list. I'm going to go over a sample sequence using a video we created for Brett Kissel's song Make a Life Not a Live. The video starts with a wide shot. Within a few seconds, you know that there's a man by himself at night burning something. We cut to a medium shot on the fire to direct people's attention to what he's burning. We cut to a tight shot in the form of flashbacks to give more context on what's in the fire. We cut to a medium of Brett so that we can see how he's feeling emotionally. Next, you can see a medium of a box, a wide of him walking away from the box, and a tight of him walking past a luxury car. Every shot tells a story and gives a little bit more information to the viewer. This principle is going to be the same for any type of video, but you might want to swap the order for social media. For example, your hook might land better if it's a medium of you talking before getting into the rest of the video. You might also be able to get away with never showing a wide because the location isn't important to the story. Use this knowledge as tools in your belt that you can use however you like. Transitions. There are thousands of transitions in video, but quickly, here are a few of the popular ones. I'm going to go fast because there's a ton of resources for this online, but if it's not clear, try watching this back a few times. The basic concept is hiding cuts between shots so that two shots feel seamless. The whip. Here, you're hiding the cut in the motion blur of the camera. Make sure you whip out of the first shot and into the second. Next is the wipe. For this one, you're using the black frame at the end of one shot and the beginning of the next shot to make it seamless. It's the same idea as covering the camera lens, which is popular on social media. Next is the match cut, using two similar shots to make them blend seamlessly. This isn't to be overused, but it's great for a little extra flavor when you need it. Camera movement. Similar to how the color blue gives people a sense of security, whereas red gives them a feeling of danger, every camera movement subconsciously makes people feel a certain way. It's important to know what every camera movement means so that you can use it to tell your story. Left to right. In North American culture, movement from left to right is considered forward progress. The most obvious example of this is the written English language, but you'll also find it everywhere from charts to video games. As a rule of thumb, try to keep your subjects moving from left to right if you want to keep your story moving forward. We also keep all of our camera movements moving from left to right. You should break this rule when you want something to feel jarring or like it's moving in the wrong direction. Tracking. A tracking shot is when you're moving with your subject. We love using these shots because it adds energy, movement, and interest to something that could otherwise feel stagnant and boring. What's the difference between our bucket and the free one paint comes in, hours cost $50 and says yeti on it. This can be done for walking interviews or bureau. A tracking shot makes you feel more like you're there with the subject. Smooth versus shaky. Smooth camera movements feel satisfying and comforting, whereas shaky movements feel more energetic and raw. If you're shooting meditation on a mountain top, you'll want the movements to feel smooth and refined. But a chase sequence up to the mountain top should feel shaky and fast paced. You achieve the shaky footage by shooting handheld and you can get smooth footage by using what's called a gimbal. There's versions for your camera or your phone and we're going to go through this in more detail later on in this course. Tilt and roll. Anytime you're not shooting level with your horizon, it brings uneasiness to a viewer. This is something you should only use if you want to build suspense or make people feel uncomfortable. I'd say 99.9% of the time our horizons are perfectly straight, but this is a great tool to keep in your belt. Something we do any time we can is try to find foreground to shoot through to add more movement and depth to our video. It can add a lot of context to your shot and bring a lot of life or energy. This can be a plant, home decor or someone's shoulder. If you're pushing the camera towards a subject, you're telling the viewer that the object is important. Similarly pulling out from the object makes you feel more separate or distant from the subject. As a rule of thumb, we like to keep our videos pushing in. It makes people feel more connected and more immersed in the content. These are the main movements to be aware of and it's important to know what they say to a viewer, but use them as tools and create your own style. Frame rates. Almost all movies are shot in 24 frames per second because it looks the most natural. Now what does that mean? I want you to imagine that every frame is a photo and a frame rate is how many photos are flashed for every second of video. This allows you to get motion blur that is similar to what is seen by the human eye. I'll show you the difference. This is what it looks like shot correctly and this is what it looks like shot incorrectly. I know this sounds like overkill for creating phone videos, but on most phones you have the option to shoot in 24, 30, 60 and sometimes 120 frames per second. You'll want to shoot as close to 24 frames as possible for the most natural looking videos. So why would you want to use the higher frame rates? This is how you shoot slow motion footage which can be smoother and more cinematic. Imagine 60 photos flashing in one second. If you stretch that out to 24 frames per second, it becomes more than two seconds. Why is this important? Because there will be times when you want a smooth, stable shot either of a product or an action and this is a great way to do it. Rule of thirds. One of the oldest rules in the book is using this grid for creating content. Try to keep the things you want people's eyes going to on those lines and intersections. A big exception especially for vertical video is using center framed footage. If this is your first time hearing about this, you're going to start seeing the rule of thirds absolutely everywhere in photography and video. A good rule of thumb for vertical video is to keep people's eyes as close as possible to the third lines. This gives your subject lots of headroom which is the space between the top of their head and the top of the frame. Angle. Whenever you're shooting up on someone or something, it makes them look powerful and in control. The opposite is true if you're shooting down on someone. For example, if you're shooting a CEO of a company, you might want to consider a bit of an up angle to make them feel more powerful. If you've been creating videos for a while, a lot of this is probably old news. But if you're hearing these concepts for the first time, I would highly recommend watching this lesson a few times. These principles are the basis of all video production, whether you're creating a super bull ad or a video of your dog. As an exercise, I want you to take at least 30 minutes after this lesson to pull out your phone or camera and work through all of the concepts that I've laid out in this lesson. Now we're going to take these fundamentals and use them to build out our storyboard and our shot list. We'll see you in the next lessons.
