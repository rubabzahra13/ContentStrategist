 The very first lesson in this course will teach you the most valuable skill you could possibly acquire in business. How to create an offer so good your audience would feel stupid, say no to it. By the time you complete this lesson, you're going to understand exactly how to present your product or service to an audience in a way that makes them shout, I need to have this. So without further ado, let's get into it. A common misconception about course creation is that you need to be an absolute expert with years of experience in your niche before you can teach people. This simply isn't true. Let me explain. Pretend you love apples. If I promised you that I was going to plant you in apple tree in a pot right inside your kitchen and in three months, it would produce the tastiest, juiciest, healthiest apples all year round. Would you care how many years I had previously spent studying apple trees? If you're like most people, it probably wouldn't even cross your mind. That's because we're attached to the outcome and not the process. I want you to deliver me the best apples as quickly and painlessly as possible. I don't care if you're a descendant of Johnny Apple seed as long as you get me the damn apples that you promised. Although that probably would add a ton of credibility. When we created the TikTok and Reels creator course, we were nowhere near the largest creators on any of the platforms. In fact, we had less than 50,000 followers at the time, but we did know how to format a video to consistently get hundreds of thousands of views even on a brand new channel. So that was the promise we made to our audience. And once people started getting the results, we promised them our course spread like wildfire to over 100,000 students in just over a year. Ultimately, the point I'm trying to make is that you don't need to be the top expert in the niche you're teaching. As long as you know more than the people you're going to teach, and you can promise them their desired outcome. And that is what creating a killer offer is all about. Now, let's break this down into three easy steps. Selecting your transformation, framing your offer, and making it irresistible with a guarantee and bonuses. Let's start with number one. Deciding the transformation you're going to help people achieve. What area do you feel confident you can deliver results in based on your past experience? What is something you've accomplished that thousands of others are also eager to do? Who is the most likely person to buy the solution that you're selling? How big of a problem does what you know solve? Hopefully you already have some idea of what and to whom you're going to be teaching. But if not, these questions should get your mind spinning. When you're deciding on your niche and subject, these are important things to consider. Number one, what is the most painful problem that you can solve in your niche? Number two, how many people does your course apply to? If any. And number three, how much are people willing to pay to have this problem solved? For example, let's say I have a mom of three kids all over the age of five. In my experience raising these kids, I have learned a lot about parenting. From nutrition to organization hacks to early education. However, I know a painful problem I can alleviate is the worry new parents feel when they come home with a newborn. I've done this three times. My audience has never done it. That means I'm three times more experienced than they are and I have a lot of value I can offer because I have three healthy kids of my own. So the painful problem I will address is helping new parents create a safe home for their first baby. Now, how large is this market? I can quickly use Google or chat GPT to research the audience size and get an estimate result of 1.5 million first time parents in 2025 in North America alone. That's a fairly healthy, addressable market. And it renews each year. But how much are they willing to pay for this? Again, we can do some quick market research here by asking how much new parents typically spend on safety equipment for newborns. The range chat predicts is 500 to $1,000. Obviously, this fluctuates drastically, but this gives us a great base range to understand how much parents will be willing to spend. I should also note that a child's safety really has no price. So if you can provide solutions that alleviate any risks to first time parents, there is a broad range they'll be willing to invest. Based on these considerations, I'm feeling pretty confident that this is a viable product. Now, you might be thinking, but wait, aren't there other people who already teach this stuff? Yes. Absolutely, without a doubt, you will have competition. But nobody else is you. Nobody else has your unique experience and that is what can make this work once you figure out how to position it. When we decided to make our TikTok and Reels course, almost everyone we pitched it to warned us that there were hundreds of courses out there already filling this gap. But we knew nobody had done it quite like we could. Competition is something to take into consideration, but it shouldn't deter you if you have something great to offer. Instead, use it as fuel for your fire and ask how you can be better than the rest. Okay, that's step one out of the way. Now for the fun part. Step two is going to be framing your offer, which is done by promising the desired outcome to your audience as clearly and concisely as possible. Imagine you're standing on a sun-baked, barren, deserted island with no food or water, and $25 in your pocket. Just over the horizon, you can see a jungle utopia covered in tropical fruit and a waterfall of fresh drinking water. All that lies between you is two miles of ocean. Now, imagine there are four people standing on the shore. The first is selling water wings for $5. Although they would get you there, it would take a ton of effort and would probably take all day to swim across. The second has a life raft with a rocket attached using duct tape. He's selling tickets to get across for $10. The ride will only take 60 seconds, but you're not too confident it's actually going to get you there at all. The third is selling tickets for his yacht for $25. Although it looks nice, he says it will take three days to get to the other side, and there's no crew or food. So not only are you going to have to learn how to cap to any yacht first, you're still not going to get any fresh water for three days, which is the only thing you really want right now because you are thirsty. And the fourth has a speedboat. It's $20 and the ride will take 10 minutes. Which would you go for? The speedboat is fast, easy, reliable, and you'll still have money in your pocket. The best option isn't always the fastest, the cheapest, or the most extravagant. It's the best combination of all of those things. And that's what makes up an ideal offer. When we came into the market with our course, there were $7 guides, which just like the water wings were cheap, but required a lot of time, work, and no guarantee you'd get there at all. There were also courses where you could use AI to create a hundred pieces of content in three minutes, which like the rocket ship was fast and extremely easy, but seemed unlikely to work. There were courses with 90 lessons and 35 hours of content for $1,200, which like the yacht looked awesome, but felt like a lot of time, effort, and cost to get to the result. And we came in with the best of everything, an offer that was affordable and fairly easy, but people could see how it would have a high success rate. When you're creating your offer, you want to find a speedboat, the sweet spot of price, effort, time, and perceived likelihood of success. Now, coming back to our mother from step one, how can she position the solution to her audience's problem? In a short, punchy, 15-word sentence that would provide total clarity even at a quick glance? This is the goal we're aiming for. This offer will live at the top of your landing page, and it's the very first thing your audience will see so it has to be incredibly compelling. We use a part of a framework from Alex Formozzi when we create these offers, and it looks like this. Get Dream Outcome in time period with or without experience level. So for our newborn safety course, it might look like this. Learn how new parents can create a baby safe home in less than two hours. As you can see, I rearranged the order to experience level, Dream Outcome time period, because it felt a little easier to understand. But now my audience knows exactly what they can expect if they stick around to learn more about my product. I've added a few more examples of powerful offers into the lesson description for you to read later. However, this is only half of the offer. Next, we're going to make it irresistible. Step number three is your guarantee and bonuses. The final step in your offer creation process will be making it truly irresistible by coming up with a great guarantee and bonus stack. This is where you can make people feel like they'll be missing out if they don't take you up and buy your product. They need to see a clear return on their investment and feel like there is absolutely zero risk in making the purchase. So how do we do that? Enter the guarantee. When we released our TikTok and Reels course, the sales were pretty slow initially. But after we had a few case studies from students who were using what we teach to get millions of views, we gained some confidence. So we decided to create a ludicrous guarantee. It looked like this. Get one million views in your first 30 days or get your money back. No questions asked. This was one of the scariest things we've ever done as a business because we had no idea if people would actually be able to implement what we teach and successfully get millions of views. But we hoped that it wouldn't matter. We felt that the course material was so good that even if people only got 10,000 views, they would be stoked on everything we taught them. So what ended up happening? That guarantee allowed us to scale from 2000 per day to over 30,000 per day, all while decreasing our refund rate to 3%, which is less than industry average. On top of that, we also included a list of bonuses to help ensure our student success. For us, that was a free Facebook group, a bonus lesson showing how we created a viral video in real time and our editing shortcuts to make your video editing workflow 10 times faster. These were all things that we had already made and planned to include with the course. But when you position them as bonuses, it creates more perceived value for your audience and gives them more reasons to buy. You can think these through in the planning phase of your course, but even if it's an afterthought, there should be a way to split up your course into the core products plus bonuses. Let's use our mother with the newborn safety course one last time to create a guarantee. Goal is for our students to feel confident that their home is safe for their new baby. So an easy starting point would be to say, if this course doesn't give you 100% confidence in the safety of your home, we'll give you your money back. But let's say you don't want to offer a money back guarantee right away because it's too risky for you. Okay, well, maybe we can add another layer of support instead. Now it could look like this. If you're not 100% confident in the safety of your home after taking this course, you can book a free 30-minute consultation and virtual home inspection with me. Now we're giving them the added security of one-on-one support if the course doesn't work. Not quite as strong as money back, but still provides a lot more confidence to potential buyers. Now that we've worked on our guarantee, we just need to tie it all together and add a few bonuses. Here's what the final offer could look like for the baby safe course. Or how new parents can create a baby safe home in less than two hours. Free 30-minute consultation and virtual home inspection, if you're not 100% confident in the safety of your home after taking this course. Plus three free limited time bonuses, $297 value. The other elements that you can add to an offer to make it even more enticing are called scarcity and urgency. Let's use our desert analogy again for this. Scarsity would be if the person with the speedboat said, I'm only doing one crossing today. Then you looked over your shoulder and saw a few more travelers coming over the horizon. You would want to jump on that opportunity before the limited spots were taken. And urgency would be if the driver said, if you sign up in the next minute, you can open my cooler and have anything you want on the way over. Now if you were on the fence before, that would be enough to make the final decision. Course creators add scarcity and urgency by doing things like limited time cohorts where the doors to enrollment open and close within a certain window. And or also adding limited time bonuses and coupons. So to summarize everything in this lesson, a perfect offer includes a desirable transformation that can happen with the least time, effort, and cost possible. The perfect offer also feels like it's completely possible all while taking any risk off of the customer. And if you can do that, then you've built yourself a speedboat offer that is going to be irresistible to your customers. Before you move on to the next lesson, head down to the lesson description and complete the create your offer exercise I have laid out for you. Once you're done that, I will see you in the next lesson.
