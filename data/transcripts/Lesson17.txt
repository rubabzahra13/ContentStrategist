 Welcome to BrainStorm. In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to effectively brainstorm for content creation either by yourself or with a group. This is a process that's different for everybody, but there are some principles that I believe work, no matter who you are or what you're trying to accomplish. Before you start brainstorming, make sure your research from the previous lesson is fresh in your mind, like what's unique about the product you're creating content for and what other creators have done for similar projects. This is what you'll be referencing throughout the BrainStorm process to spur directions and ideas. First step, what's available? The first step to the BrainStorming process will be making a list of everything that you have available to use. In this list, you can include locations, people, objects, outfits, props, skills, or anything else that you think can be relevant to the project. If you have a budget for your content creation, practically any of these things can be replaced with money. For example, if you have great talent in props but no location, you'll need a budget to rent a location. I spoke to a high school class about content creation and their biggest row block was that they felt restricted because they were stuck in their school. They didn't realize that the school is what set them apart from other creators. Production companies pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for access to hallways, classrooms, school equipment, and unlimited eager extras. Let's use the video that we made for Aviation Gin as an example for this. We had no budget at all, so everything in the video had to be things that were available to us. My list of things that we had available for the video was this. A beautiful landscape, a truck, a male and female actor. There were three of us, but one of us had to shoot the whole time. Formal clothes, a nerf gun, a bottle of Aviation Gin, and the props that were sitting around our house, like an old backpack. We also had a sound bite that we found in our research with Ryan Reynolds saying, Aviation American Gin, you'll actually die of happiness. From that list, I had the idea to do a Bonnie and Clyde style police chase. Here it is, you can see. I'm sure this is worth it. It's the last one on our soap burby. The Aviation American Gin, you'll actually die from happiness. All of the same principles apply no matter what type of content you're creating. Time in place. Billionaire Sarah Blakely, the creator of Spanx, lives minutes away from her office, but she takes the long way, adding an hour onto her commute every day because she has her best ideas in the car. Similarly, Einstein used to say all his best ideas came while he was shaving. Personally, all of my best ideas come before I fall asleep, so I intentionally go to bed an hour early when I need to brainstorm. Figure out where your mind can wander, you can relax, and let your best ideas come. Usually, it's not while you're at your office staring at a computer. Over the next week, I want you to try different places to brainstorm. Try walking through your neighborhood, go for a drive, have a long bath or shower, or go to bed when people get busy. This is usually the first thing to go, but in my opinion, it's the most valuable time for a content creator. So I want you to stop the video, pull at your calendar, and schedule at least 20 minutes of brainstorm time daily. And schedule it as if it were an important call with your boss or client. While you're brainstorming, pay attention to whether your mind wanders where you want it to, and how creative you're able to be in the space you're in. When you find the time and place that's most effective, that will be your super weapon, and you should treat it as such. In improv, there's only one role. Yes, and. The only way to keep spontaneous creativity flowing is for everyone involved to keep the ball rolling. The moment someone says no, the show is over. A lot of our best ideas have started with something absolutely ridiculous. But if you expand and elaborate on a bad idea, you'll always be able to find some good in it. So you have to accept that any idea could lead somewhere amazing. This mostly applies in a group setting because if any idea gets shot down, people will be afraid of making suggestions. Even if an idea has no merit on the surface, encourage it and keep the ball moving to see if it could go somewhere. You'll find that an idea naturally keeps growing if you give it a chance, and it'll fizzle out if it doesn't get everybody fired up. Similarly, don't stifle ideas when you're brainstorming solo before you've had a chance to see where it could go. To start, also ignore potential roadblocks. There are a million reasons to shut down an idea, but if you like the idea enough, sometimes there's a way around all of those roadblocks that you wouldn't have thought about if you shut it down to begin with. Let me give you an example. We got asked to create a video for a produce delivery service. I had an idea to have someone opening their fridge, and on the other side of the door, there would be a farmer stalking it with produce. At first, even I thought the idea was crazy. We would need to build a kitchen set, out of farm, lighting for both indoor and outdoor all at once. But as the ball kept rolling, and we kept throwing ideas around, we realized that with a little creativity, we could make the concept a reality. Rather than bringing the fridge to a farm, we figured out a way to turn the inside of a fridge into a green screen, and stitch that with the green screen on a table out of farm. This creativity also led to more content showing how we achieved the look. We were able to turn our biggest roadblock into our biggest strength. Hey baby, honest movie? I'm not really much of a smoothie guy, and you can call me Spud. Another important thing to remember is maybe you don't have the skills to pull off an idea now, but be open to the possibility of learning how to do it. Every new project should add a new skill to the tool belt. Our very first content creation project was for a luxury resort, and it was before we had ever created a single video, like even for fun. I just had the confidence that I could learn and pull it off. Funny enough, the video still plays on a loop in their lobby. The best combination. What we found to be the best combination is a mix of solo and group brainstorming. We start by independently coming up with ideas. When we all have a number to share, we get together and bounce them off each other. It's important not to get too attached to any idea so that it can evolve or drop off if they're better directions. Once we decide on a direction as a group, we find it's easiest for one person to independently flesh it out for the. This works best for us, but a lot of the time in a writer's room, the whole process is collaborative, so experiment and find out what works best for you. Always be ready. 95% of your mind is subconscious. That means that while you're going about your day, 95% of your brain is working in the background, taking in information and inspiration. If your subconscious has a job to do, like coming up with an idea for a product, there's a good chance it can do the heavy lifting for you, but you have to be ready. Always be prepared to write ideas in your notebook or phone because you could have a breakthrough at any moment. That same subconscious is also running in the background while you sleep. As a college student, Larry Page had a dream that he somehow managed to download the entire internet and turn it into links. When he woke up, he burst out of bed, grabbed a pen, and wrote down a vision for what we now know as Google. The same is true for James Cameron and his vision for Avatar, one of the top grossing movies in history. If you're not using your subconscious, you're growing with the wrong side of the paddle, so keep a pen or your phone notes ready for when your next creative idea comes. Now I want you to go through this process for yourself and brainstorm for your own brand. Make sure to time block the brainstorm sessions and treat them as seriously as an actual shoot because this time is even more important. So remember, you're going to list everything you have available. Time block your brainstorming in new places so that you can see where your brain fires best. Create a list of rough content ideas using your product or brand. Remembering no idea is a bad idea. Find another person or group to bounce ideas off of explaining the yes and theory and see how far you can take your concepts. Once you have all of your rough ideas down, it's time to build them out and make sure they stay engaging all the way through. Next up, Khan is going to be teaching you the fundamentals of storytelling.
