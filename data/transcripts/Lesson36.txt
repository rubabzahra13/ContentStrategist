 Harry Potter was rejected 12 times before getting published. Van Gogh was only able to sell one painting in his entire lifetime but still created over 900. Walt Disney was fired as an animator for having a lack of imagination, and Stephen King was rejected 60 times before getting his first book published, and that first book sold more than a million copies in the first year. Almost all big success stories can be attributed to a quote that's been the backbone of our business since day one. Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. In this lesson, I'm going to explain the power of persistence and why if you only take one thing from this course, it should be this. Alright, here's a stat that I love. 90% of podcasts don't get past Episode 3. That's 1.8 million people who quit. Of the 200,000 who do make it to Episode 4, 90% of those will quit after 20 episodes, which is another 180,000 people. So if you make it to Episode 21, you are already in the top 1% of podcasters in history. I don't have a stat for creators who only make it to three pieces of content, but I can pretty much guarantee you'll see a similar trend. The only way to be successful in this industry is by being persistent. You'll probably have a lot of videos flop and you'll probably try a lot of directions that don't go anywhere. But the only way that you can fail is if you stop trying. Before Mr. Beast was giving away millions of dollars in every video, he was sitting in front of a camera saying PewDiePie 100,000 times without stopping. The real success comes when you can combine relentless persistence with all of the other tools that we've provided in this course. The reason I've given so many examples of the power of persistence is I don't want you to be discouraged if you create 5, 10, or even 100 posts and don't see the results that you're hoping for. Now that that is hopefully sunk in, I'm going to show you our favorite tool for keeping consistent. Our favorite way to stay consistent is creating challenges with our content. A great example of this was our ad-solation campaign, where we decided to create a video from start to finish every day Monday to Friday, which would be released at 8 pm. If we hadn't set a challenge with strict guidelines, we probably would have stopped after day two when it wasn't going as well as we thought and we were starting to get a little tired. But by day three, we were gaining thousands of followers and by the end of the second week, we were on the news, getting the attention of Ryan Reynolds and having all of our dream brands reach out wanting to work with us. The challenge. The next exercise is the one that is going to change your life. For the next 30 days, you're going to be using everything that you learned in this course to create a piece of content every day. Each piece of content will be shot, edited, and released within 24 hours. First, using everything that you learned in Module 1 about creative mindset, I want you to create goals for what you want the challenge to do for you. If you work for a brand, maybe you want 50,000 new followers. If you're a freelancer, maybe you want 10 global brands to reach out. I want you to write down whatever fires you up and feels unrealistic to achieve within 30 days. But this list somewhere that you're going to see it every day and keep coming back to it. I want you to choose a date within the next two weeks to start the challenge and put it in your calendar as a non-negotiable start day. Even if you work 40 hours a week and this is your side hustle, you can still create one piece of content daily. If it's not possible to clear your calendar for this, you can still work around whatever you have coming up. Next, it's time to brainstorm. From now until the challenge start date, you're going to be researching and brainstorming content ideas. Revisit the storytelling module if you need help coming up with ideas. I would recommend trying to think of way more concepts than you need so that you can keep picking your favorite from the list to create every day. Going into our challenge, we had the first few laid out, but by day four, we were out of ideas. So we would post our video for the day at 8pm, then it was time to brainstorm for the next day. Giving yourself that pressure and not giving yourself any opportunity to back out will push you so far creatively. Before your start date, take some time to practice the skills laid out in this course. If you've never talked in front of the camera before, put up your phone and practice telling stories even if you never post them. Then toss them into Premiere and practice cutting the walls for a quicker pace. The main takeaway from this challenge should be to make all of the processes from this course second nature. A lot of the learning will come once you're actually doing it, but it doesn't hurt to go into the challenge warmed up. Next, you're going to set the parameters of your content. For us, we did a one minute ad for any brand we wanted, and a day filled with Instagram stories. Casey Neistat was one of the original vloggers and the challenge he created for himself was to make a vlog every day. It was roughly 10 minutes in length and could cover any story arc you wanted. Decide the length of the videos you're going to post and the type of content it's going to be. Are you going to be creating skits, trends, vlogs, songs, how-toes, product reviews, dances, the list is endless. One of the most important things to remember for this exercise is Parkinson's law, which is everything will take as long as you give yourself to do it. For example, if you give yourself all week to create a piece of content, I guarantee it'll take you all week. You'll spend longer setting up props, you'll do more takes, you'll hum and ha over the script, but nine times out of 10, it doesn't make the end product any better. To do this exercise, you need to have strict time boundaries on every activity. For us, we started shooting at sunrise around 6am, and we knew we had to finish shooting everything by roughly 10am, so that we could get back and start editing. Sometimes this meant driving to multiple locations or problem solving, but we always made it happen. If we hadn't set that boundary, those shoots would have taken all day, which we know from experience. Schedule your day accordingly. If you only have a small window of time, you can create content during the day, break it up into smaller chunks for shooting and editing. Maybe your only time to brainstorm is while you're driving to work. Give yourself the expectation that by the time you get out of your car, you have a concept ready to go. You might not always be able to finish the task in the time you give yourself, but if you give yourself 10 times longer, I guarantee you'll fill it. One of the easiest ways to force yourself to be persistent is your accountability. When you tell somebody you're going to be doing something every day, there's suddenly a lot more pressure because it's no longer just your own expectations for yourself. With every piece of content you post during this challenge, I want you to use the hashtag find your peak. The moment you make your first post, us and everyone else taking this course will be watching and holding you accountable to be persistent. No matter what, don't quit. I promise you'll get better every single day and the growth you'll see by the end of this month will be unbelievable. We genuinely cannot wait to see what you create. We know it's going to be amazing. And that concludes the Find Your Peak Content Creator Course. Thank you so much for joining us. I hope that you have learned so many valuable lessons about content creation and from the three of us here at One Peak, we cannot wait to see what you do with everything that you've learned.
