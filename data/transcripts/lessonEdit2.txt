 In this brief lesson, I'm going to show you the quickest and most efficient way to storyboard your videos so that you can go into every shoot with extreme confidence that you will get everything that you need. So here are the things that every storyboard needs to have. The first is the location. Your entire shoot can be in the same location, but an easy way to make your video more interesting is just to move the location around. So this can be as simple as moving around in the same room like a kitchen, or you can move your location entirely if you want to make the video more engaging. Number two is the transition. Now a lot of the time this is just going to be hard cuts, meaning going straight from one shot to the next shot in a different location. But if you're going to be doing any of the transitions that we talk about in the coming lessons, like the wipe transition or the lens cover, you want to make sure that you're mapping this out really well so you have all the shots that you need. So location, transition, the third is action. So if the person is going to be doing anything in the shot, you want to be including that in your storyboard. Fourth and most important is the script or a point form idea of what the script will be. I encourage people to go into your shoots without a script, but it's great to have a general idea of what is going to be happening in the video. So let's say you're cooking something in the kitchen, you might want to make a note on what you're going to talk about while you're putting the ingredients together. Make a note about what you're going to talk about while you're putting it into the oven. This can help you to be a lot more clear on the shoot day and understand what's going to be happening. So you don't get overwhelmed while you're shooting your videos. A mistake I see a lot of creators make is they try to make the storyboard too complicated. When we were running a video production company, our storyboards looked like literal comic books. We had visuals of what was happening. We had the script. We talked about the action, the location, transitions. And when we finally got to the shoot, we would open this comic book storyboard and feel completely lost because it was so complicated. So over the years, we've streamlined this so much to the point that when we get to our shoot, this is all we're looking at. Just a document in the notes on my phone that has all of the actions and scripting and locations, just written out in sequential order. Super simple. So my challenge for you is to figure out what works best for your brain and make this as streamlined as possible because it doesn't need to make sense to anybody else. But if you're able to look at it and know exactly what's going to happen in your video, you're going to be set up for success. And if you want to steal our way of doing it and just write it out like this, I think it's amazing. I never miss a shot doing it this way. And I can clearly imagine what the video is going to look like just by reading this. If you want to see what this looks like in practice, here are the scripting notes as well as the actual video so that you can follow along and understand the way that we laid this out. Here are three steps to a slam dunk visual hook that got me views like this. Step one, choose a location that's going to stand out while people are scrolling. Like here, here, or here. Time to get out of your living room. So recap on storyboarding. Make it as simple as possible to understand everything that's going to happen. Make sure to include your location, action, transition, and script or scripting notes. And that's it. Make storyboarding simple, but make sure that you do have one because it's an extremely easy way to feel more confident when you get into your shoots. So with that, onto the next one.
