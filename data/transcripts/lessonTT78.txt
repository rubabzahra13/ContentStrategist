 On to the fifth and final landing page example we'll be covering in this course, the editorial landing page. This type of landing page uses the style and tone of an editorial piece like a magazine or newspaper article to market a product or service. It's often told from a third party perspective of an expert or somebody trustworthy and whatever niche you're discussing to educate your customers on your product. For example, if you were selling a revolutionary new skincare product that instantly smooths wrinkles in one application, it might be good to enlist the help of a dermatologist who can speak to the revolutionary scientific method behind it. Or maybe you could collaborate with a recent customer who had an incredible Benjamin Button style wrinkle reversal. Then you can tell their story from their perspective and ask for their approval before publishing. Unlike your typical more direct sales page, editorials focus on storytelling, problem solving, and providing valuable content before making a sales pitch. Think of it as a feature article in a lifestyle magazine or on a popular blog. Instead of directly selling a product, it blends the product into a narrative or a case study that addresses the reader's interests or problems. For example, our friend has a business selling a series of incredible interactive journals that have been designed by real therapists to help people overcome negative emotions. The editorial style landing page for this product mimics an expert interview where a psychologist discusses the benefits of journaling to overcome emotional challenges, which naturally leads to the product introduction. It's helping educate the consumer and answering all of their questions, then positioning the product as the perfect all-in-one solution. I've included a link to an editorial style landing page in the lesson description so you can check that out to have a better understanding of what I'm talking about. So now that we have an understanding of what an editorial is, let's get into how to create one. We're going to put this lesson to the test on some real life examples for both a physical product and service-based offer. To do this, we'll be following a simple three-step process. Step one, determine who you're selling to, step two, determine what the story is, and finally step three, determine how to structure it. Don't worry, this step is basically always the same. Okay, time to get after it, step by step, starting with a physical product. Let's say you have a company that sells a Ready to Drink hydration beverage, Think, Gatorade, or BioSteel. What makes your product great is the fact that it has 100% natural ingredients, zero artificial colors, plus it allows consumers to hydrate and recover faster than any other drink on the market. Your customers even tell you it tastes the best too. We'll call this drink Peak Juice. Step number one, who are you selling this to? It's important to determine exactly which customer avatar this article will be for, so we can speak their language and truly understand the problems that they face. Your customer-based is most likely going to be predominantly athletic individuals. So, who do they trust? People like them. As an athlete, I want to hear from someone who has put this product to the test and can tell me when they needed to work their hardest and recover as quickly as possible, your drink was the one that saved their ass and allowed them to win. Step number two, what is the story? I find it helps to pull from real personal or customer experiences. But if you don't have any of those to go off of, you can just make one as you go. The goal with this story is to help your customers solve their problem. As they read, they should feel understood. Not only that, but they should feel as though the story being told is genuine, educational, and entertaining. If someone were to read this article and it wasn't selling a product, would it stand alone as a valuable piece of content? That is your goal. In this case, I'll pull from a personal example. Two years ago, I was training for a marathon. And in my longest 32-kilometer training run, I was flying through kilometers, feeling like the fastest man alive. Confidence was soaring. I was on an absolute runner's high. This marathon would be a walk in the park. Then boom! At the 28th kilometer, my legs completely seized up and literally would not even bend. Panic ensued. Do I call my wife to drive and pick me up? Maybe lay down on the side of the road and call an ambulance? Surely emergency medical treatment is the only thing that can save me from this agony. Wait, 500 meters ahead, I saw a corner store. The sign-out front was advertising three-for-one hot dogs. But maybe, just maybe, they had some kind of hydration drink inside that could get me through the last few kilometers. So I waddled up the road like a pirate with two peg legs and crashed through the front door to rush to the cooler section. There, by the grace of God was a hydration drink, I had never even heard of called peak juice. Do I really trust a store selling rinkly discount hot dogs to save me with this drink? I'd never even heard of? I don't know. But I have no other choice. I grabbed two and chugged one before I made it to the concerned looking clerk at the checkout. Now, at this point, you're probably wondering what the hell happened next. Great. That's exactly how you want readers to feel. You can find out exactly how this story ends in the PDF template that you can download in the lesson description. But before you do, let's move on to step three. How to Structure. As I mentioned earlier, this stays pretty consistent no matter what it is that you're selling. The structure goes as follows. First, you need a strong headline or hook. Capture your reader like a great book grabs its audience from the first line. In our case, the only race day hydration I'll ever use again. This corner store secret saved me an marathon. Second is customer testimonials or social proof. Using real, true stories about how your product solved a customer's problem is the best way to make editorial content feel real, genuine and relatable. If you don't have any testimonials or case studies, I would highly suggest giving your product to a few people who would actually find it useful in exchange for an honest review. Collecting testimonials is an incredibly powerful tool for generating great content. If you're interested in learning more about how to do this, we have an entire lesson dedicated to great testimonials in our video ad academy. But for now, just know that they can be your secret weapon when it comes to converting customers. Finally, step three is a clear call to action. This is your sign at the end of the journey showing readers the way forward. By the end of the article, they should feel excited and curious to try your product, so make it easy for them. I would suggest including a checkout link that brings them to your product page along with some kind of specific coupon associated with the article they just read. For example, if you want to try peak juice for yourself, you can use code hotdog for 50% off the next 24 hours. Click below and claim your coupon now. There we have it, the framework for your first product based editorial landing page. Now let's try it for a service based offer. All the same rules apply, but I find it can be helpful to give a direct example to really drive it home. Imagine you have a business that offers personalized nutrition coaching. Your service is designed to tailor meal pines based on unique individual health goals that take into account everything from lifestyle to genetics. You're known for achieving world-class results for your clients by using science-back practices and whole unprocessed foods. Step number one, who are we selling to? For this service, your target customers are probably people who value their health, or potentially struggling with their current diet, or maybe people who have specific fitness goals that require a more tailored meal plan. These people often trust experts who can provide personalized and scientific guidance that addresses their unique needs. Step number two, what is the story? For an impactful story, you can narrate a customer's journey from frustration with generic diet plans to achieving their health goals through your life. Let's say for example, a client named Emily, who struggled with gaining muscle despite various diets. She turned to your service, a bit skeptical, but desperate for real change. Through your customized approach, Emily not only packed on five more pounds of lean muscle, but also improved her overall energy and health markers. Step number three, how to structure. Just like before, we want to start with something that immediately captures attention and relates directly to the reader's potential frustrations. A potential headline could read, healthier but not hungrier, how personalized nutrition helped Emily build her dream body. Now the social proof again, incorporate real success stories from your clients, like Emily's detailed journey, which shows the scientific approach and personal attention she received to help her make her incredible transformation. Testimonials should highlight specific aspects of your service that made a significant difference. Then conclude with the compelling call to action that makes it easy for readers to take the next step. Offer them a free consultation or a special discount. For example, ready to see what personalized nutrition can do for you? Schedule your free consultation today and use code health 2025 for 20% off your first month. Now that you have an example of an editorial for both product and service businesses, you're ready to write your own. Take the next five minutes to quickly make point form notes from steps one to three while this is all still fresh in your mind. Once you're done that, you're going to want to hear about the importance of marrying your landing page to your creative. Take it away, test.
