 In this lesson, we'll be diving into the main guidelines you need to follow to keep your meta ads running smoothly. And what to do if or when issues arise. Whether it's a rejected ad, a disabled account, or performance changes, I'll walk you through how to troubleshoot these problems like a pro. Let's start with the foundation. Meta's ad guidelines. Before you run any ads, you need to understand the rules. Meta's policies aren't just there to complicate your life, although it seems like they are sometimes. They're used to protect users. So if you don't follow them, you could find yourself with rejected ads or worse, a disabled account. The first thing to keep in mind is that your ad content must be clear, honest, and aligned with Meta's advertising standards. I've dropped a link in the lesson description so you can see what those look like. For example, ads can't include sensational claims, misleading information, adult content, or illegal products. No selling body parts. Even something as simple as using exaggerated language like lose 20 pounds in a week can get flagged. I highly recommend taking a dive through all of their ad standards because it could save you a headache down the road. The first time we ever tried running an ad about four years ago was an absolute nightmare. We uploaded our first ad, celebrated, then within a few hours it got rejected. We watched through the ad, checked the ad standards, then uploaded it again because everything seemed totally fine. A few hours later, it got rejected again. So we reached out to a Meta rep to look into it. They watched the ad and apologized saying there was a glitch in their AI moderator, but we're good to upload it again, and it should be fine. So we did. A few hours later, not only did the ad get taken down, but our entire account was completely disabled. What a horrible nightmare of a feeling. And that was enough for us to give up on ads at that time in our career. We were still running a video production company, so it felt like a sign to focus on our main business. About a year later, we had created the TikTok and Reel's creator course and decided it was time to revisit ads. So we took an extremely close look at what had happened the last time to see if we could learn anything. Low and behold, when we watched the ad that had destroyed our account the first time, for one second in the video, we showed a screenshot of some press that we had received in the past. And in the related articles column on the side of the screenshot was a headline that said how many people had died that day from COVID. It was nothing we had said or done. The AI moderator had just found a tiny piece of copy in a screenshot for a split second, and it was enough to take down our entire account. I don't say this to scare you, just to prepare you. Every media buyer will face a rejected ad no matter how experienced you are. It can be frustrating, but it's part of the process. So here's what to do. First, breathe. It's not the end of the world. To avoid an account suspension, my recommendation is to test running one ad at a time. If you upload 10 versions of the same ad and they all get rejected, that adds 10 strikes to your account, which could be enough to have your ad account disabled immediately. When you do have a rejected ad, first go back through the ad guidelines to think about whether there's something that you may have missed. For example, there could have been a dangerous activity in the ad. You could have said something that could be taken in the wrong way, or in our case, there could be a tiny bit of text in the bottom corner of a screenshot that you never noticed. After making the changes, resubmit the ad for review. Keep in mind that meta's review process is not perfect. If you believe the rejection wasn't error, you can file an appeal. Just keep it professional when you're dealing with meta apps. This is about getting results, not venting frustration, and the meta apps do not get paid enough to be patient. Know that even though we've spent $5 million this year on ads, they still treat it the exact same as they did the day we opened it. Some ads still get rejected for no reason. We even had their payment processor glitch and cause our account to get suspended. They brought it back the same day, but understand this is all just part of the process. Now, let's talk about dealing with a disabled account. This one is a bit scarier. A disabled account can feel like the end of the road, but in most cases it is fixable. Accounts are typically disabled for repeated policy violations, payment issues, or suspicious activity. The first step is to figure out why your account was disabled. Meta will usually provide a notification in your business manager or email with a reason. Once you have that, you can submit an appeal. Be thorough, explain your situation and outline the steps you've taken to address the issue. While you wait for meta to review your case, use the time to audit your ad practices. Are you being too aggressive with your claims? Is your payment method up to date? Taking preventative action now will make it easier to bounce back if your account is reinstated. Now, let's say your account doesn't get reinstated. Don't panic. While this is unbelievably frustrating and the last thing you want to be doing with your time, it means you need to create a new ad account from a new profile and start from scratch. When our first ad account was disabled, I created a brand new Facebook profile and started a new ad account from that. We also have friends that have used their family members' Facebook profiles to open new ad accounts. Remember that whatever issues you run into during the process, other people have had the exact same problem. So try googling the issue to see if anyone has already found the solution. Chances are there is a forum discussing exactly what you're facing and how to overcome it. Just know it's not the end of the road, it's just an inconvenience. Next, let's talk about big changes to your CPA. If you notice that your CPA takes a big hit and your performance has dropped, there are a few things that could be happening. If your entire ad account is taking a performance hit, I want you to consider the social landscape. A lot of the time, CPA will change dramatically at times when people are dumping a lot more money into ads. For example, Black Friday comes with way more competition to deal with. Even things like an American election can cause hundreds of millions of dollars to flow into meta and compete with you reaching your target audience. If that's the case, it's up to you to decide whether to drop budgets and wait out the storm or push through. In our experience, as long as we're not losing money, we've preferred holding budgets relatively consistent because it's always possible you're having a bad ad day, and it could be right back to normal tomorrow. If you're noticing one specific ad has taken a performance hit, it could be a sign of fatigue. If that's the case, it's time to focus on getting a new creative out into the market. Overall, the key to navigating meta's ad guidelines and challenges is staying calm and patient. Whether it's a rejected ad or a sudden performance dip, every issue has a solution. As you gain experience, these roadblocks will become less daunting because you'll know exactly how to handle them. Now, in the next lesson, Navid himself is going to be walking you through how to set up your first ad. While it's an incredibly simple process, sometimes seen it done in practice can be the biggest hurdle holding someone back from getting started.
