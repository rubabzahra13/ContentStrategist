 Welcome to the final lesson in this course. This lesson probably won't be what you expect. I love to end courses with an inspirational hype up to send you on your journey, and while I'd love to lay out a fun challenge for you to make your first $1000 this week with ads, I want to take this opportunity to get extremely real with you. The tools and skills that we laid out are genuinely everything that you need to earn over a million dollars a month with ads. We haven't held anything back, and while we know that this could be creating our biggest competition, it feels like a skill too valuable and life-changing not to share. But with that being said, a lot of things do need to go right for this to all come together and provide all of the wealth and freedom that it has for us. You need to have an offer so good that as Alex Formosi says, people would feel stupid saying no, you need a sales page that can communicate that offer and the value. You need to be able to take action on everything that we've taught to create engaging ads, and on top of that, you need to have the personal belief in yourself that it's all possible. It's taken years for all of these things to come together for us. It would have been a lot faster if we had the tools that we've laid out for you, but we've had some stupid business ideas and gone in directions that didn't deserve to take off. So why am I saying all of this? We are at a place right now where everything we do is purely out of passion. This course has come out of seeing friends, family, and students struggle with their business, while we're sitting on everything that they need to turn it into something bigger than they ever could have imagined. So this challenge isn't a sexy 30-day sprint or six steps to make your first thousand dollars. That is not what you need right now. Instead, I'm challenging you to persevere through this process. I'm challenging you to be patient. I'm challenging you to not blame the meta algorithm if you spend your first 200 dollars and don't get a sale, but to look at how you can create a more irresistible offer. I'm challenging you to imagine that you're the customer and ask yourself if you would buy your product at the price point you're offering it with the ads and info that you've laid out. Through this process, you're going to be faced with a dilemma. Don't spend more than you're willing to lose and don't give up too soon on something that could have been great. Because everything that we've shared with you has been tested with millions of dollars on our own ads and products, but your journey is going to look a lot different than ours. Our greatest joy has become hearing about people who have taken our courses and listened to our life experience to transform their lives, and that is genuinely all we want for you. So whether you're about to spend your first dollar on ads or you're trying to go from 10,000 a day to 20,000, I want you to know that we are rooting for you and all of your goals are absolutely possible. So with that, get out there and make some damn ads.
