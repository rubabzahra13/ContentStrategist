 In this lesson, I'm going to show you one of the easiest but one of my favorite transition known as the whip transition, which looks something like this. Low whip transition. You whip the camera out of the first shot and into the second shot hiding the cut in the middle. Now this is super simple to do, but there's a few ways to take it to the next levels. To get this effect, all you have to do is at the end of shot one, you whip your camera out, and at the beginning of shot two, you whip your camera in. Here's what it looks like with me shooting on this side and the final result on this side. Number one, low whip transition. You whip the camera out of the first shot and into the second shot hiding the cut in the middle. Like I said, no fluff, so we're just going to dive straight into DaVinci and I'm going to show you what this looks like in the timeline. Here is shot number one. We're Meg speaking and at the end, I whip to the right. So what we're going to do is we're going to click through until you can see the motion blur happening. Motion blur is when the shot gets blurry because the camera is moving and we're going to wait until we've got that motion blur and we're going to click E. Now if you remember from the previous tutorial, E just trims the end of this clip. Now the next shot, we're going to be coming in from the left hand side moving in the same direction into Meg, just like that. What we're going to do is we're going to pick a spot somewhere in this blur and we're going to click Q. Now remember Q gets rid of whatever is at the beginning of the clip before the playhead. E is what gets rid of what's at the end of the clip after the playhead. If you need a refresher on this, it's all in the original DaVinci tutorial earlier in the course. So now we're going to do is we're going to pull these clips over to each other and let's watch it back and see what it looks like. It looks pretty good, but the transition is a little bit long. So what we're going to do is we're going to cut this shot right at the beginning of the motion blur. I'm going to click E there. Then I'm going to take a few frames off the beginning of this clip here and click Q. Now let's watch it back again. So as you can see, that's super smooth. One way that I've learned to make this transition feel a little bit better when people are watching it is you start whipping away as the person is finishing the line. And you start whipping in as they're starting to say the next line. A lot of the time when I've seen this transition in the past, someone will whip in and then the line starts. And so you get about a second of blank space in between the two shots where there's nothing going on except for the whip. I know this sounds wild, but we live in a time where people's attention spans are so unbelievably short that having a one second where there's no speaking or anything like that happening feels a little bit too long. So I like to have the speaking happening while the transition is going on and that just brings it together a little bit more. The next way to take this transition to the next step is adding something called a WUSH, which is the sound effect that helps to tie these two clips together. I've added one into the video downloads, which you can add to all of your videos. And I'm going to quickly show you how to add it in. So all you're going to do is you're going to find the clip wherever you downloaded it and you're going to take it and you're going to drag it underneath. Now we're going to go in and we're going to zoom in with this right here. And we're going to make sure that this lines up right in the middle of that effect. Now when we watch it back, it helps to tie those two clips together. Now it's a little bit loud. So we're going to click on the WUSH. I'm going to lower the volume. Great. That's a small detail, but it really helps to tie that effect together. And anytime you do that transition without that effect, it feels super jarring for some reason. But putting that in takes to the next level and makes it feel really nice. A couple more things you can do. The whip transition left and right. You can also do it up and down. And a little pro tip if you're doing up and down is in the second shot, get your talent to do just a little drop into the second shot. And it makes it feel just a little bit more immersive kind of like this. And the world shut down and we couldn't work with actors anymore. Business got quiet. Go test this out. Have fun with this one. And I will see you in the next one.
