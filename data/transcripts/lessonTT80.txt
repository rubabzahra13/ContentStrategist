 Welcome to the final lesson in this course. How to get traffic to your landing page. Let's say you've just crafted the most irresistible landing page on the internet. The copy is gripping, the visuals are stunning, and the offer is so good, anybody would feel stupid saying no, but there's one problem. Your page has no traffic. It's just sitting in the vast internet, collecting virtual dust. It's like putting your heart and soul into throwing a party that nobody comes to. So let's talk about the three main ways that you can get people to the party. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how to position your landing page like a hot dog stand at a baseball game with thousands of hungry customers lining up at the end of each inning as predictably as the sun rises and sets. The first and my personal favorite way to get traffic is paid advertising. As we've said before, we've spent over $5 million in the last year on ads, and it's accounted for over 95% of our sales, getting to 100,000 customers. I will say it can be risky. There's a real possibility that you put in $1,000 to find out that either your ad, offer, or product aren't winners, and it's time to hit the drawing board. But the risk can be worth the reward because one great ad can keep making you money for literally years. We have ads that were shot in four hours on an iPhone in our house that have made millions of dollars in sales. As a matter of fact, at the time of filming this course, we haven't launched any new ads in the last two months, and yet we're still consistently bringing in 300 new customers a day. The main reason ads are so powerful is the meta ad algorithm. It's designed to reach people who actually want to buy your product. You know when you casually mention something to a friend and suddenly you're getting hit relentlessly with ads for that thing? That's because the ad algorithm is legendary at getting in front of the right people at the right time. The other perk of ads is that you don't need an organic audience to make them work. When we started running ads, we actually excluded anyone who had ever seen or interacted with anything we had ever created. This is because we knew that if someone only bought because they knew who we were, the offer would work for a couple weeks, but as soon as we got through those people, it would fail. So you don't need an audience at all to make this work. If you want to learn how to create high converting ads or how to run an ad campaign on meta, we have courses on both those subjects that you can find in the lesson description. And because you're a student, we also put a bundle with both of those courses in the lesson description so that you can get exclusive pricing on both courses. We go in detail into everything from scripting to creation and our exact ad process that has allowed us to turn $1 into two over five million times in the last year alone. The next strategy for getting traffic is organic content. This means Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, anywhere that you can post organically and get your message in front of an audience. The main benefit here is it's completely free. You can get literally hundreds of millions of views without ever spending a dime, meaning that it's no risk to you apart from your time. I know people that have also broken $10 million in a year with only organic content and no ads, but it does have a few downsides. The first is time. If all of your traffic comes from organic content, you need to be extremely consistent. Not all your videos are gonna be home run, so you need to post enough to keep up a consistent flow of traffic. The other challenge with organic is it's a bit harder to convert viewers into buyers. With ads, you can be direct about what makes your product so amazing, but that same messaging would flop in an organic post. You need to provide a ton of value that convinces people it's worth going to the link in your bio and paying money for your product. If you wanna learn how to structure viral videos and get the most out of organic content, we have a course that teaches short form video for TikTok and Instagram Reels. We have students who have taken it and gotten over a billion views and used it to sell literally millions of dollars worth of products. If you wanna check it out, there's a link in the description. The third way that you can drive traffic is by convincing someone else to promote it to their audience, otherwise known as affiliate marketing. While this has been a small part of our strategy, there are people making millions of dollars through affiliate marketing alone. We personally give up to 50% commission because that's roughly what we spend on ads to acquire a customer and we've had small blogs do over $20,000 in sales. So in summary, the quickest ways to get traffic to your landing page are paid traffic, organic traffic and affiliate marketing. And if you wanna get started with paid or organic, we have resources on both that will help you take the next step. A big piece of advice I have is to start by picking one of these traffic sources and mastering it rather than trying to do a little bit of each. People have built successful businesses solely from organic, solely from paid and solely from affiliate marketing. So start by choosing one to master, then branch out once the first avenue feels like second nature. Okay, thank you so much for taking this course and don't forget to message us when you have a landing page bringing in millions of dollars for your business so that we can celebrate together. I'll see you in the next one.
