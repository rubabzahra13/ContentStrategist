 Welcome to the FIND YOUR PEAK TICKTALK AND REALS CREATOR COURSE. Nah? I liked it. That's pretty good. Oh! By the end of this course, you're going to be able to confidently use the systems we teach to start reaching millions of people on social media, whether it's TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube. Hell, we've even had students go viral on LinkedIn. I'm dead serious. I'll be teaching this course along with my two business partners, Glenn and Kahn. Who are also creators? Together, we have used this strategy to not only get hundreds of millions of views on our own channels, but to also help over 40,000 students, like Alex, who just surpassed 50 million views on one video and has already done a billion total views this year. That's a lot of views. Our goal is to help FYP students become the most viewed creators on the internet. So far, we're doing a pretty good job of it, and since you're here, that means you have joined our mission, whether you're creating faceless content in your kitchen or documenting high adrenaline adventures. Selling soap or scaling a software business, we've been able to help every type of creative and entrepreneur in every niche imaginable around the world. So what we teach will help you, but only if you're willing to commit to the process. When we first launched this course, our focus was on TikTok because we believed it had the best algorithm for growth. But as we and our students began to use the strategy on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube shorts, it became clear that this is a strategy that applies to all short form video platforms. Our student success stories on Instagram have now far surpassed the success stories on TikTok. For this reason, throughout the course, when we say TikTok, we are actually talking about all of the short form video platforms. For the purpose of this course, we'll be using examples from our own personal channels that we built as case studies to prove that the systems actually work. And they do. These channels include One Peak Creative, Honest Ads, and of course not. I know it does. Megan Glenn, and Connor Fairway. Collectively, we've received hundreds of millions of views and seven figures and brand partnerships on those channels. Those results came from a decade of creative videos, which we've boiled down into a course that you can watch in two hours. The core systems that you'll learn are based on principles that have worked to tell impactful stories since the dawn of time. I'm talking caveman era. These aren't just quick hacks and trends. They are timeless tools. But that also means it takes some time to perfect your approach. If you're like our student, Jerry Carey, results can come overnight. Later in this course, you'll watch a video of us helping them to create his very first social media video ever. Okay, so you're going to be shooting everything on your iPhone and we'll do like ultra-wide mode. So it's kind of like a first person perspective of you coming up and approaching me. Literally the first video that he ever created in his life. That video got over 2.5 million views on a brand new account with zero followers. And since then, he's been traveling the world creating content and he's gotten over 100 million views and 200,000 followers across TikTok and Instagram, as well as six figure sponsorships all in less than eight months. Can we just appreciate for a second how wild that is? But that isn't always the case. If you're like our student mailing, it might take some trial and error before you find the right format in a video that breaks a million views. But trust me, it will happen. You just have to commit and realize that you'll never fail if you never quit. God I love that quote. What happens from there will absolutely blow your mind. Before we dive into the course outline, I'm going to share a few more student success stories with you to really drive home how life changing this course can be for you. First up is Steph. She's a lifestyle creator. Before taking our course, she had been struggling for years to grow her channel. Since implementing what we teach in this program, she's grown a brand new channel to 350,000 followers, and she's now making about $15,000 a month with affiliate sales. Then there's Lewis, a videographer with a marketing background who was struggling to make his videos pop. He implemented everything he learned into a new video for his client, and that first video alone got them over a million views and 8,000 new followers. Or Alex, who I mentioned earlier. And he's using what we teach to consistently get hundreds of millions of views on his videos. And it's now creating content full time, generating $20,000 a month. All three of these creators have vastly different niches and approaches to creating content. But they've all been able to dramatically improve their lives using the lessons you're about to learn in this course. And if you want to see a library of other success stories, I've put a big ole list of them down in the lesson description so you can go and check them out. Okay, let's dive into the lesson plan. Before we can dive into the strategies, we have to understand why we're creating content in the first place and how it's actually going to get us paid. That's what we'll cover in our creator economy lesson. You're going to love this. Then, I'm going to explain the ins and outs of the algorithm. While social media algorithms are incredibly complex and mysterious, there are some key principles that can give you a leg up when you understand how they work. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are businesses and they make more money the more time that people spend on them. For Matt. So, algorithms are rewarding watch time more than any other metric. For that reason, almost everything in this course is geared towards getting you as much watch time as possible so that you can climb the algorithm faster than you could possibly imagine. Remember, watch time is gold. Better than gold. What's better than gold? I don't know. It's really good. Next, I'll be going over our viral video checklist. When we started on TikTok and Instagram, we noticed everything we posted that received hundreds of thousands to millions of views, had a few key details in common. So we built those out into a checklist. But in order to prove that it could work, we would have to test it out on brand new channels. Sure enough, our videos got hundreds of thousands of views. How crazy is that? While it can be challenging to come up with an idea or a format for your channel that follows this checklist, once you do, it will be your roadmap to consistent success on social media. I do also want to clarify that if you added our posting checklist to your cart, these are two very different things. We just really like using the word checklist for some reason. The checklist you added to your order is actually a list of mandatory things to remember every time you hit post. So if you didn't get a chance to pick that up, I've put it in the lesson description below for you. But the checklist lesson that we provided for you in the course goes in depth on the elements your video format needs to include, like, relatability and shareability. So how do you come up with a format that actually works? That's the tricky part. But it's also what we'll be covering in the next part of this course. We believe that there are some key video formats that consistently perform well across all of the platforms, which will be going over in detail. It's really important to have a good understanding of each category, test a number of the ones that speak to you, and then continue pursuing the formats that resonate with your growing audience. That way, your audience knows exactly what to expect from your channel every single time you post. This section is going to help you brainstorm for new ideas that relate to your niche or brand. Next, Meg's going to go over tips and tricks to increase engagement, as well as the Holy Grail watch time. We'll talk about ways to create conversation in the comments by using controversy and relatability. This lesson will teach you how to connect more with your audience and make them feel like they are a part of your community. After that, we'll be going into creating the actual content, where we'll be sharing what type of gear you need, how long your video should be, ways to incorporate B-roll, voiceovers, and all of the tools and tricks you need to actually stay organized. Make sure you're getting everything you need before going into the edit. After that, we'll be talking about editing for short form video. Over the last 10 years of creating videos, we've developed so many useful tips and tricks to keep people glued to your content with creative editing. We'll be going over everything from flow and color to adding text and graphic elements. There is so much psychology in editing, and when used properly, it can lead to the most engaging, captivating content possible. Then, we're going to be showing you all of the best practices for posting your videos and getting the most out of every single one. We'll go over whether you should be creating a new account or posting to your current one. We'll also be inviting you to take our 30-day creator challenge, where you can put everything you've learned in this course to the test and start growing faster than you ever could have imagined. It's awesome. You're going to love it. Now that you know how to consistently create engaging content, congratulations. We'll be teaching you everything you need to know about brand partnerships and how to actually get paid to create. This includes how to get your first brand partnership, cha-ching, when to accept a deal, and how to incorporate sponsored videos seamlessly into your content in a way that your audience will still actually love and want to watch. This is very important, and you're going to master it. Due to popular demand from our students, we have also included a bonus lesson on how to use these systems to get millions of views without even showing your face. We're talking faceless content, baby. Alright, that's the lesson plan. It's everything we've needed to build an audience, confidence, and even a career on these platforms. And if you're still looking for a little extra support, you can access our Find Your Peak Facebook community, where there are thousands of members coming to share their ideas and provide feedback to one another. If you have any questions or want support with your content, that is the best place to find answers, and everybody in there is so nice. Plus, I'll be sending you new emails every week with creator tips, bonus resources, updates from our team, and the occasional funny gift. Because who the hell doesn't love a funny gift. Also, if you're looking to continue stacking your creator skills, we have a bunch of additional tools and resources that you can find in the sidebar of this course. From an AI brainstorming tool to an entire mini course on perfecting the first five seconds of your video, the art of hooks. Okay, this is pretty much everything you need to succeed as a creator. So let's dive into it.
