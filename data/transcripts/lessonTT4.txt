 This next lesson is by far the most valuable in the entire course. When we started testing and learning on the platform, only every 20 or so would shoot past that 100,000 view mark. And after a while, we noticed that every one of those that went to that next level had a few things in common. In this lesson, I'll be explaining in depth the six items on our checklist that allow our videos to get hundreds of thousands and often millions of views on a consistent basis. Step 1. The first and the most important item on the checklist is the hook. This is the first three to five seconds of the video, and it's what every viewer watches to decide whether it's worth sticking around or whether they're going to keep on scrolling. Your hook needs to be so good that it stops viewers in their tracks and leaves them needing to know how the video is going to unfold. Let's dive into the two elements of a hook, messaging and visuals. Typically, a hook leans entirely on the messaging to rope in viewers. It clearly and concisely tells the viewer why the content is worth their time and what they're going to get if they stick around to the end. It can be someone talking to the camera, text on the screen, or a voiceover. A good messaging hook will capture people within your niche, but an amazing hook is universally captivating, no matter who you're speaking to. Let me go over some examples of good hooks and why they work. My daughter has a phobia I've never heard of in an absolutely ruined notification. This is a post I made to my account that got over a million views. Within a few seconds, viewers have a deep curiosity to find out what the heck the phobia was and how it ruined our vacation. Yes, it will resonate the most with parents, but it is a strong enough hook that it can be effective for people without kids as well. Since the video is just me talking to the camera, it relies 100% on creating enough curiosity that the viewer feels the need to watch through to the end. Okay, now let's talk about secondary hooks. It's possible your hook is good enough to get people part of the way through the video, but you could also add a secondary hook that's going to help drive them to the end. Here's what that can look like. On Khan's golf channel, a hook that worked really well was letting a stranger decide what course I play. Letting a stranger decide which course I play. This created curiosity about what the stranger was going to say. Then he used the secondary hook 15 seconds later. Looks like we're going to go to Hawaii and beat this guy's score. To drive people to watch the rest of the video, and it worked pretty well for him. The video's got over a million views. Another example of a primary and secondary hook is a video that we did that started with this. This is what we do every time our daughter poops. Sounds gross, but hear me out. Instantly, there is a curiosity around what it is we do. The secondary hook is a card game that we play to decide whose turn it is to change our diaper, and we're creating curiosity around who wins. Adding stakes and a winner or loser is a great hook because people innately want to know how the challenge resolves. This video went on to get over 8 million views and counting. Next, let's talk about the visual hook. It's possible to draw someone in just with visuals alone if it's interesting or satisfying enough to keep watching. Here's a great example of visual hooks by Zach King. The most viewed video on the TikTok platform with 2.2 billion views uses someone flying a broomstick in a suburban cul-de-sac as a hook. It's visually interesting enough that it keeps people watching and audiences stick around to find out how the heck they're doing it. There are a ton of other examples of visual hooks from dances to cooking videos where the food looks so delicious that it just pulls people in. If you believe that your niche is incredibly visually intriguing, it's possible that you can rely on visual hooks, but I would say that 99% of the time you should be including messaging for your hook as well. I'm going to drive home the importance of a great hook by sharing my own experience. When I first started posting, I had no clue how important it was to have a strong hook at the beginning of my videos. I would simply capture a cute or funny video of my toddler, post it, and expect that people would find it as cute or as funny as I did. I struggled for a long time, unable to wrap my head around why I was stuck in that 2-3,000 view range. I'm embarrassed to admit that it took months for me to realize that I was the problem. It's just too easy to blame the algorithm these days. So on a whim, I decided to take a look at my analytics. What I found was a shockingly common trend. All of my videos were seeing a significant dip in viewership in the first 5 seconds, which means the viewer didn't even get the chance to see the cute reaction or funny moment at the end of my video. But why would they? Without the hook, they didn't know the reason for sticking around, or that they would even be a payoff. As soon as I started incorporating a hook, my views went up by hundreds of thousands literally overnight. This was one of the biggest lessons I've learned as a creator, and hooks are now my top priority for every single video. If my video doesn't have a hook, I don't post it. Okay, so now you've got people's attention with a good hook, but how do you keep it that way? The second step on our TikTok checklist is to cut out all the laws. Any ums, ands, or just blank spaces. I'll explain this concept briefly because we will be diving into it in the content editing lesson, but essentially you want to remove any filler from the video or moments that are just unnecessary to the story. Really any dead space at all. The hard truth is that if you bore a viewer for more than a second or two, they're scrolling. Even if you nailed the hook. The next time you're scrolling, I want you to pay extremely close attention to the moment you scrolled past a video. Chances are the video slowed down or veered from what Hooked you in the first place. The more curiosity you create from your hook, the more the viewer is willing to sit through and get to the payoff at the end. But it is a delicate balance, and you should assume the audience has the attention span of a baby monkey. Let's put a baby monkey up there. Step three on our checklist is including a payoff. Have you ever watched a video that Hooked you in, got you invested and excited only to leave you feeling super disappointed? I know I have. And that's because they skipped the payoff, which in my experience on the platform will only ever result in an upset audience. An example of this I saw recently was a girl who was sitting in a human-sized water balloon filled with diet coke. Don't judge me. We have all been roped in by a silly video like this. Anyways, someone was dumping Mentos into this balloon, and the hook said, wait till the end, it pops. Yeah, I'm watching that. I watched for almost a full two minutes of anticipation, only to find out it never actually pops. I hopped into the comments, and it was hundreds of angry people venting together about how disappointed they were to lose two minutes of their lives. If you want longevity on the platform, never do this. And here's how. Take a look at the hook from your video, and make sure that whatever curiosity or excitement you created in the first five seconds is resolved in the last five. That's an important detail. A mistake I see a lot of creators make is putting their payoff in the middle of the video. Don't do that. One of our TikToks had the hook. When I woke up and saw Ryan Reynolds commented on my video, I couldn't believe it. When people hear this, they need to know what the heck did Ryan Reynolds say. And also, what was the video? If we gave that all the way 15 seconds in, you've gotten what you've came for, and you're scrolling, regardless of how great the rest of the video is. This in turn tells the algorithm your video is a flop, because it's only getting 15 seconds of average watch time. Make sure your payoff is in the last few moments of the video, and you'll see success. The number four in our checklist is Relateability. Now Relateability is the key to people's attention. Remember that. If I start talking about characters from a show in the 60s, you're probably going to tune out because you can't relate. But if I start talking about your all-time favorite TV character, you're going to be locked in. We created a video with the concept if Honda ads were honest. And the reason it got over a million views is so many people can relate to owning a Honda. And TikTok was able to feed it to that niche. Every single comment on that video is someone talking about how much they love or how much they want or need a Honda. The best way to do this is by finding your niche and sticking with it. If you're a golfer, you might watch a full video of someone playing a round of golf, because their experience is relatable to you. And that same video could have no appeal to someone who's never played the sport, because they can't relate to the experience. The fifth item on the checklist for success is Shareability. If you get sent a video from a friend, it instantly has credibility. And you know you're probably going to like it and you're probably going to watch it. So what makes content shareable? You associate everyone you know with categories, whether it's the car they drive, what they eat, their hobbies, their likes, their dislikes. And as a content creator, you need to create content that resonates with at least one of those niches. Let's talk about an honest ad we did for Tesla as an example. This video has over 300,000 shares. I believe that's because everyone either knows someone who has had a Tesla or has an opinion on them. And because the people associated them with their personality, it is extremely shareable to those people. For instance, the Tesla hashtag has over 24 billion views, which shows it has a mass audience interested in that content. Do I drive a Tesla because I think it makes me better than everyone? Of course not. I know what does. The last item on the list is repeatability. If you have a viral video, but it's not repeatable, then lightning will never have the opportunity to strike twice. It can also save you an immense amount of time, testing and trying new formats all the time. Find a format or hook that works, and instead brainstorm ways you can repeat it in a new light. Here's an example. Looking at the videos on our Honest Ads channel, we start each one with the hook. If Big Brand name ads were honest, we quickly learned this hook and video format is infinitely repeatable. All we had to do each time is come up with a funny, relatable script for a Big Brand everybody knew and shoot it in a way that looked like a fancy ad. The same goes for my own personal TikTok channel. I found that the format of surprising my husband or trying to trick my husband performs really well. So instead of reinventing the wheel, I can simply find new ways to bring that format to life. What started with tricking him to try a jackfruit inspired me to repeat the format with Clamato Juice. And both videos performed super well. And now I have a guide to follow so I can come up with other concepts in that vein. Your goal should be to find a few different formats, which we will go over later in the course, that perform really well on your channel and that you can repeat. This is going to save you a ton of work and it's going to keep your audience super engaged as well. From now on, I want you to put every TikTok you create through this checklist. Is it relatable? Is it shareable? And is it repeatable? If it is, you might have a hit on your hands. As an exercise, I want you to go through any content you've created and see how it performs on this checklist. Watch the first five seconds, then pause the video. How hooked are you to watch until the end? Be very honest with yourself. Apparently, jackfruit can look and taste like pulled pork, so I'm going to try and trick my husband. Then continue watching, thinking about whether there's any laws, whether it's repeatable, if you could add a secondary hook. If the post did do well, is it a format you could repeat? If you haven't created enough content to do this, go to literally any channel and then see if you can predict the videos that will do well without looking at the engagement at all. Typically, by thinking about this checklist, you can tell which videos are going to pop off just by watching them. Lucky for you, we've included a digital version of this checklist and it's attached to the lesson description. So I highly recommend keeping that close for all your future posts. The end, thin, moving on to the next lesson. See you over there. I actually won't because someone else is doing it.
