 Now that you have an understanding of the customer journey and the importance of objection busting, you probably feel ready to start getting your offer out into the world. How exciting! But before you can go on to sell that amazing product or service, you need to be crystal clear about one very important thing. Who your audience is. In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through how to build out your customer avatars to make sure all of the effort that you're putting into your ads is resonating with the right people. We'll start by walking through what a customer avatar is, how they can inform your scripting and visuals, and then the four steps to consider when building out your own avatars. It's time to define your audience, baby! Let's do it! If you want your message to be a slam-dummed with potential customers, the first step is to figure out who they are and then more importantly, why your offer might be important to them. As author Stephen Covey famously wrote, seek first to understand then to be understood. With that in mind, your job is to pinpoint your audience, understand the problems they face, and then provide them with a solution to solve them. Your offer. I cannot stress enough that creating your customer avatar is one of the most important exercises to work through as a marketer because it's going to act as a guide every time you go to create your ads. So what's a customer avatar? A customer avatar, also known as a buyer persona, is a detailed profile of your ideal customer. Think of it as a fictional character that embodies the characteristics, behaviors, goals, needs, and the pain points of your target audience. To dive into it even deeper, your avatar should include demographics like age, gender, income, plus more detailed insights like motivations, personality types, fears, desires, and even their buying behaviors. Your job is to understand those avatars inside and out. Even go as far as giving them a name and a physical description, which I know sounds a little silly, but it can really help you with the creative process. Sometimes I find a great place to start is basing your avatar of someone you already know that would benefit from your product. Now a big mistake I see people make is assuming that they only have or need one avatar. When in reality, there's many that you're going to want to tap into when it comes to marketing your offer. This is because no customer is exactly alike and who you want to market to is probably going to shift over time based on your goals. Your best chance of success is going to be by testing a variety of ads created with slightly different audiences in mind. That way, you can determine what market responds to your ads best. What's interesting is as you go through this process, you might discover that what you assumed would be your winning audience isn't actually who you should be marketing to at all. A huge lesson that I've learned in marketing is this. What the data decide? Not your good. I want you to begin by building out three to four customer avatars. Now this doesn't mean that you need to immediately create three different ads. It's simply just a great exercise to pinpoint your ideal customers and get those creative juices flowing. Let's walk through a quick example. So let's say you sell a healthy protein bar called peak protein. See what I did there? You're going to begin by making a list of three potential customer types who may want to buy your super awesome healthy bar. The idea here is to give them a title and a brief description. Here's what that could look like. Number one, jewels the gym junkie. It's an protein boost after her intense workouts. Tracks macros and sugar intake because it's so important to her what goes in the body. Number two might be Ella the clean eater. Interested in finding snacks that have clean ingredients and are sustainable. Reads every ingredient on the package. We all know somebody like this. Number three is Adam the average Joe on the go. Interested in a healthy bar option that can fill them up and is using them as snacks but also when they do activities. I suggest organizing these avatars by how much the product resonates with the audience. That's because typically it's going to be easier to sell to the audience that wants your product the most. Think about what avatar casts the widest net that you can market to and what ones are a little more niche. In this case, the avatar that casts the widest net would probably be Adam the average Joe on the go. And the most niche would probably be Ella the clean eater. It's also possible that one of your customer avatars are hungrier than the rest. Pun intended. Again, this is going to help you decide what avatar you want to market to first based on your goals. But it doesn't stop there. Now it's your job to really get to know each of these avatars inside a note. So now we're going to reference the workbook. I'm going to show you how to build out each of these avatars for yourself. And in order to do this, you are going to want to dive into the four major components of a customer avatar. Number one, goals and values, two, interests, three, demographic info, and four challenges and paintmoins. In an ideal world, you'll be able to one day build out your avatars using real insight from your customers already in your database. But if you don't have that just yet, feel free to make your best educated guess for all of these categories. So let's now walk through each of the components for example, avatar number one, jewels the gym junkie pro tip. I find you can make your avatar feel more real by basing them off someone who you actually know that fits these characteristics. So for this example, I'm basing gym junkie jewels off of a friend of mine who is huge into healthy eating and building strength in the gym. I've also added a build your avatar worksheet for you to use as a guide in your workbook. Feel free to open that up now and work through building out one of your customer avatars as I go through this section, starting with component number one, goals and values. This is where you want to think about the goals and the values that are important to this particular avatar. This is really going to help you define what this avatar cares about. It'll help you get clear on what motivates them and how you can incorporate that into your marketing. So when it comes to goals, jewels for example might want to increase your muscle mass, gain weight lifting competition or consistently meet your daily macros without eating all of that crap. And when it comes to her values, jewels is probably committed to living a healthy lifestyle, maintaining a strong work ethic and being accountable. I've left you some space to fill out this section for yourself. Next, you're going to want to pinpoint your avatar's interests. This stuff is super important because this is how you are going to be able to relate to your avatar in your messaging and in your visuals. Relatability is so important. When it comes to great performing ads, relatability is key. In your workbook, answer the following questions in point form in as much detail as you can to build out a relatability list. What do they do in their spare time? What brands do they follow? What shows, books or podcasts do they consume? What other products can they not live without? Where would you find them just hanging out? What does their morning routine look like? What gurus do they idolize? What bugs or noise them? Now I know this might feel like a lot of work, but I promise you that this list of interests is going to be so helpful when you dive into the creative brainstorming and the scripting process later on. Number three, demographic info. Breaking down your avatar's demographic info can really help bring your customer to life. This includes all the usual facts like age, gender, location, job title, and so on. I also find it really helpful to fill in a personal mantra as this is going to help you really get inside the head of your customer and show their personality. I've included an example of how to do this in your workbook and a space to fill it out for your own avatar. Making the time to narrow down your demographics will really help you talk to your customers more persuasively when it comes to scripting your ads. So please do not skip this step. And lastly, number four, challenges and pain points. Finally, I want you to think about the problems, the challenges, and the pain points in your customer avatar's life. This is going to really help you relate to your avatar on a deeper level and determine which of your offers will solve their problems best. But it's also going to help you write, copy, and add creative that speaks to their pain points, compelling them to take action. So in this case, jewels might be challenged with juggling work in her fitness passion, keeping a healthy diet, finding time for good meal prep, and sourcing healthy snack options. And jewels pain points might be fear of growing old and her body failing her, fear of not looking the way that she wants to, and that she can't wind a protein bar that actually tastes good. So now that we have all this information, let's put it into practice. For example, when I'm going to try to sell jewels, we might address her pain points with scripting or copy, such as, so you want to get stronger but can't bear to eat another one of those nasty chocolate bars? Listen up, girl, are you bust in your ass the gym, but your biceps still looks like a deflated water balloon? I know why, let me explain. You see, language like this will get a response from jewels because it talks directly about the challenges she's facing in a way that matches her personality. But don't worry, we're going to go so much more in depth with this in the scripting lesson later on in the course. And there you have it, you now have everything you need to build out your customer avatars. Woohoo! I encourage you to specifically set some time aside in your calendar to work through the worksheet in your workbook that we've provided, building out your own avatars. Remember, basing your avatars off someone you know is going to be such a great place to start. Working through this process is super important and it's really going to inform the direction you choose to take your content creatively. And if you work with a team, make sure to share this exercise with them when you're done so you can get their feedback too. Next, we're going to chat about how to define your offer. See you there!
