 Buckle up, we've now gotten to what we think is the best part of this entire process, creating those damn ads. Now that you've got the fundamentals under your bell and you're familiar with all the types of ads that convert, it's time to pick what you feel is going to be the most effective and get creating. I'm going to set the stage with one of my favorite quotes from Albert Einstein. Creating is seeing what others see and thinking what nobody else has ever thought. This is your opportunity to flip tradition on its head and make waves with your ads. We encourage you to be open to the uncomfortable, embrace the tough bits and really commit to creating the best ads anyone has ever seen in your industry because here's the kicker. Most people are scared to stray from what they know and they probably never will. They're okay with mediocre performance but that is not what we teach here. The fact is this, the best ads are born from people willing to take creative risks every single time. Now this module is a big one and maybe the most important of this entire course. So I really encourage you to soak everything up, take notes and complete any of the exercises that we provide so it all sinks in. In the following lessons, we're going to cover the importance of researching your competition and how to analyze ads in your industry using Meta's ad library, visual storytelling techniques and how to build an effective shot list, how to write a compelling hook for your ad and the importance of testing different hook variations, how to write a kick-ass script and tips for keeping people locked in from the very first second until the very last. Editing for retention and how to strategically keep audiences engaged using unique editing tips, how to write strong ad copy that pairs strategically with your video creative, and we're even going to break down how we created a seven-figure ad so you can see all of this in practice. This module, it really is a game changer. You're about to go from just playing the ads game to becoming a true advertising trend center in your market. Think bigger than just ads that look good, we're talking ads that tell a story, grab attention and really stick with people. By the time we're done, you're going to have a collection of ads that not only convert, but also give you the confidence to keep pushing that envelope. This isn't just about improving, it's about redefining what's possible for your brand and setting new standards of excellence. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's do it.
