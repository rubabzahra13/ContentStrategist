 The first question everybody has when they start running ads is how much should I be spending and how do I know if I can increase my budget? In this lesson we'll be going over exactly how much you should be spending right now and when it's time to scale to the mid. Let's address the question on everybody's mind first. How much should I be spending on ads? Here is how we decide. Our number one goal is to run ads profitably. So your first step is to take a look at how much money you make every time you get a sale. Our rule of thumb is when you're starting out, look at the amount that you're selling your product or service for. And if you don't get a sale within two times that ad spend, turn the ads off and work on refining the ads, offer and funnel before trying again. For example, our average order value at the beginning was $90. So when we started running ads, we needed to get at least one sale within the first $180. If we spent that first $180 and didn't get a sale, we would turn the ads off and look at what levers we could pull to increase profitability. If this is a new concept, let me explain. Think of every step of your funnel as a lever. Your ad, your ad copy, your landing page, your offer, your price point, your upsells, the list goes on. What you need to do is find the weakest link in your funnel and pull that lever to increase conversions. For example, if your landing page is incredible and converts customers well when you get them, but the ads aren't performing great, your ads are what you need to focus most of your attention on. Here are some quick rules to help you decide what needs the most work. If you're not getting anyone clicking on your ads, meaning cost per link click is above $8 or click through rate is below 1%. Your ads don't do a good enough job creating curiosity and you should refine the ads. You might need to do a better job of pointing out the problem the potential customers facing and make them eager to learn more about your product by clicking through. If you're getting a lot of people on your landing page, but none of them are actually buying it, it means you need to look at your offer, your landing page copy and structure or even your price. And our video ad academy, we go in depth on what specific metrics mean when it comes to the actual ad creative. For example, if your click through rate is good, but your hook rate is low, you might be able to just create a better hook for the ad to increase conversions. Once you pull a lever and improve part of your funnel, it's time to try again and see if you can get a sale profitably. Keep in mind, your first sale will be the least efficient sale that you'll ever get. Since your account has very little data on who your customers are, it's going to improve dramatically after that first sale. That is a major milestone that you should give yourself a pat on the back for. You're going to continue this process until you're able to consistently get conversions profitably with the minimum ad spend. Then it's time to increase your budgets. We'll go over exactly how to do that in the next lesson. When you're only spending a few hundred dollars a day on ads, it's going to feel extremely volatile. Since you might get three sales one day and zero the next, it's best to look at longer time horizons like a week rather than looking every day on its own. When you start spending thousands of day on ads, your customers per day could fluctuate by dozens without having a massive impact on your profit. But in the early days, especially, you can't judge your overall success by one single day's performance. Also, even after your ads are profitable, you can keep thinking of which levers can be pulled to make your ads more profitable, 1% at a time. So once you're able to spend the minimum amount, what can you look at to decide whether it's time to increase budgets? This answer will be different for every single business. For us, we like to turn $1 into $2. So that's our benchmark. We'll call it your sweet spot. Because we only get repeat customers when we put out a new product and we don't put out new products very often, it's important that the initial return on investment is solid. We incrementally increased budgets until returns drop below that threshold. Then we worked on improving the elements like the ad creative, landing page, and offer to improve conversion rates and keep increasing budgets. We could likely spend twice as much on ads as we are, but the profit margins would be significantly lower. There would be more stress on our customer service team, and we would fatigue our videos much faster. For a lot of businesses, breaking even to acquire customers is a win, because those customers come back every month to buy something new. If you have a high rate of returning customers, your benchmark for whether to scale or hold steady could be whether the ads are breaking even on the initial purchase. If you haven't already done this within your business, I want you to set a sweet spot for what you want your profit margins to be. Write down how much you feel you can spend to acquire a customer. This is gonna be your benchmark for whether you can afford to increase spend or if you need to work on your funnel. For reference, our cost to acquire a customer is $55 on a $110 lifetime value, and we've done that 90,000 times in a little over a year. The next tool for deciding how much you can scale your ads is understanding your total addressable market, which is how many people the product could potentially be sold to. Let's say you're selling Unisex white t-shirts. Your total addressable market is just about everybody on the planet. If you're selling treats and toys for pet budgies, your addressable market is going to be much, much smaller. That means if you're selling budget accessories, your total daily ad spend is going to be significantly smaller than the t-shirt business before you can reach a cap and can't spend anymore profitably. Things that will affect your total addressable market are, price point, is it financially out of reach for part of the world? Geographic location, are you able to ship and fulfill your product to Japan or the UK or Australia? Pre-requisites, like the budget example, does this only apply to people who already fit a certain criteria? Demographic, does this only apply to women or people over 70 years old or infants? Chances are the amount you can spend before you reach your cap is going to be significantly higher than you think. But here's what that has looked like for us. Currently at $25,000 a day, we get a consistent number of new customers every day at an extremely comfortable profit margin. What we find is if we increase budget, our profit margin decreases. The two ways to break through these thresholds are, number one, create new ads that resonate with a larger or different audience, and number two, increase profit margin by improving the funnel. Next, we're gonna look at the metrics to decide whether an ad is a winner. A lot of people will tell you when you're running ads, you should be looking at things like cost per click and the cost for a thousand impressions or CPM. And while these metrics have a purpose, the one metric you should be focused on when deciding whether to increase your budget is your cost per acquisition or CPA. There will likely be times when your cost per click goes way down. We had days when it went from a $6 cost per click to under 50 cents. Naturally, that sounds like a great thing. You're getting way more traffic, which will mean better sales. But the reason the clicks started costing less is because the ads were being served to significantly worse traffic. That's why at the end of the day, the number one metric you should be focusing on is your cost per acquisition or cost per purchase. And if the profit margin on your ad is good enough, you can scale until you find the limit where the return drops off. That's the theory behind scaling ads. And in the next lesson, we're gonna get into an actionable strategy that will help you decide what ads to scale. It's called the penny method, but it will make you a lot more than pennies.
