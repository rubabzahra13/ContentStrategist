You've probably noticed while scrolling through social media, there are a ton of different types of video ads out there, and most of them really bad. From unboxings to testimonials, to product testing, or social experiments, the list is long, and because there are so many directions to take your ads, it can get a bit confusing and when deciding what particular kind of ad is actually going to move the needle and drive results that you are striving for. Don't worry. This module is going to give you some clarity. So whether you're brand new to the ads world or a seasoned advertiser, excited to brush up on what style of ads are actually working best these days, you are going to love what comes next. In this module, we're going to walk you through our step-by-step process for developing the main types of ads that have worked exceptionally well, not just for us, but also for our clients. We'll be sharing real life case studies and examples so you can see what each type of ad looks like and how to apply the strategy for different types of businesses.
