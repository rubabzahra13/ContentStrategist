 So you know that you need great watch time and relatable, shareable, repeatable content. But how do you come up with those ideas that are going to skyrocket your growth? In this lesson, I'll be helping to push you creatively with inspiration and examples of viral formats that you can relate to your own niche, product, business, or hobby. Let's go. When TikTok first came out, people were scared to join because they thought it was all just dance videos, and if they couldn't dance, they weren't invited to the party. This could not be further from the truth. So let's talk about some of the niches and categories you might be able to pull inspiration from for your own channel. Most creators on the platform choose one of the following formats, and use them consistently for all of the content that they create on their channel. The first category is content based around a creator's everyday life. This can be similar to a vlog or Instagram story showing your day or even telling a story of something that happened to you talking to Cam. This is the most common type of content on the platform, and it's what I see done poorly the most often. The biggest mistake creators make when sharing their life on the platform is assuming that people know or care about who they are. That sounds super harsh, but you have to assume that the person watching has never seen your face before, and you have five seconds to convince them that they should spend their valuable time watching a part of your day. The video before yours might have been giving $50,000 to a stranger, and the video after might be asking a stranger to travel to France to get them a baguette. You want your video to be good enough that it can compete with anything else that's on the platform. Starting with a clip from your vacation with music, or by saying something like, hi everybody, I'm Thomas, and today we're making spaghetti. You're going to get an instant scroll because you haven't given people a reason to care. I'm sorry, Thomas. That's where the hook comes in. To successfully share moments of your life with an audience, you need to find hooks in your everyday life. Here's an example. Make it planned on making me pulled pork sliders using jackfruit. And she asked herself how she could turn it into a piece of content. She used the hook, apparently jackfruit can look and taste like pulled pork, so I'm going to try and trick my husband. She took a regular part of our lives and got over five million views because within five seconds she created enough curiosity that people wanted to stick around and watched my reaction to the faux pork. I want you to think about your everyday life and see if there's a part of it that you could share or dramatize to create an engaging account. Remember something that might be mundane or boring to you could be riveting on the platform, but you have to create interest and enough intrigue with a well-crafted hook. Next, let's talk about educational content. This is where the sole point of the content is to provide knowledge or inspiration to a viewer. It can be anything including topics like science, cooking, pop culture, news, movie facts, conspiracy theories. This list is literally endless. The hook for this content is usually a look at what you're going to learn by the end of the video or why the fact is something that you need to know. The hook was enough to skyrocket the career of a creator sharing mildly interesting life hacks. An example of this on Khan's golf channel is using the hook. The video goes on to show his coach giving him a lesson on aim. The channel isn't primarily educational, but it's a format that he's able to easily sprinkle in because the people that watch all of his other videos will also find that interesting. It's easy to think that people won't care about learning about your niche, but the truth is if you can create a captivating hook and enough curiosity, someone will listen to you talk about any subject. If you're an informational or analytical person, this might be the group for you. Think about your niche and whether there's an angle or areas where people are under-educated or might be interested in learning more. The next format is using strangers in your videos. These are concepts where creators take unsuspecting people and bring them into their content. A lot of the time it's heartwarming, like giving money to someone who seems down on their luck. The hook for this style of content is people's innate curiosity to see the reactions of strangers, which is a strong innate curiosity. A few examples are asking luxury car owners what they do for a living or asking strangers if they'd like $20 or to double it and give it to the next person, but it can also be as simple as asking strangers with headphones in what they're listening to. These have all gone viral recently. Going this direction takes a little more confidence because you need to interact with people who may or may not be interested, but it's a concept that breeds virality on TikTok. This is a concept that we've used on Khan's golf channel that has consistently crushed. Whether it's asking a stranger if they golf and then if they say yes, seeing if they'll play around. Or asking a stranger for their favorite whole and going to play it. Now this might be disappointing to hear, but most of these videos are actually set up in advanced. For example, Caleb Simpson is someone who asks people what they pay for rent in New York, then gets a tour of their place. But when he started, after a full day of trying, he couldn't get a single person to cooperate. So he started calling friends and making it look real. When it comes to Khan's golf content, we would probably have to ask 100 strangers before someone actually agreed to come play around with us. But playing with a stranger is a better hook than playing with a friend, so we made it look authentic with a couple takes and some basic acting. If you go this route, try to think about what people's reactions would actually be like in every scenario. If you're pretending to prank strangers, don't pretend they can't see the person filming right in front of them. And if a real person would be hesitant by your request, just keep shooting takes until the person you're working with can pull off reacting like a reluctant stranger. Excuse me. It's pretty easy to make people believe that something isn't staged, but if it's done wrong, it can be extremely cringed and people will call it out in the comments. All of that said, if there is a way to work with real strangers in a genuine way, you're always going to get the best and most authentic reactions. It's at least worth a try to see if you can mix in some real people. It can be scary, but also fun and definitely worth it. Have a think about whether you can take advantage of this viral TikTok format in any way for your niche. Challenges. Challenges are a massive part of culture and a format that consistently does extremely well. When you can work stakes into a piece of content and gamify your niche, it gives people a reason to watch your videos until the end. Some recent viral examples of this are the tortilla challenge where two people go back and forth slapping each other with a tortilla and the first person to laugh and spit out the water in their mouth loses. Another example is the sprite challenge where two people drink a bottle of sprite and the first person to burp loses. I think it's physically impossible either way, absolutely hilarious. Most people wait until they see a trending challenge, but this is a format that's easy to create unique versions of. For example, on Magonize channel, a video where the person who pulls the highest card changes the next diaper, got 8 million views. Highest card changes? Highest changes. And on Khan's golf channel, I told them I'd buy him lunch if he makes par on the next hole. Without any stakes, I don't think either of those videos would have performed at all, but by adding a win-luse scenario, it makes the video worth watching until the end to see how it concludes. People just want to see who wins. I don't know why, it's just a thing that people want to see. The next style of TikTok video is showcasing skills, like singing, dancing, acrobatics, pottery, the list is endless. There's something wildly satisfying about seeing someone who has perfected a craft no matter what it is. There's two types of hooks for these videos. First, if the person is unbelievably talented, the hook can just be how satisfying it is to watch or hear their skill. A great example of this is a video that went viral recently of a girl singing in a parking garage. She did a vocal run that was so impressive, it turned into a trend with people trying to do the exact same thing. The video had no hook at all, just a caption that said that was extremely hard. The hook was entirely how talented of a performer she was. For the other 99.99% of the world, there needs to be a better hook that pulls viewers in to want to watch or hear the skill. We live in an age where people have been exposed to absolutely incredible performers, artists, athletes, etc. But you don't have to be the very best in the world to get people's attention. An example that recently went viral is a singer pretending to be a horrendous street performer, singing confidently out of key. Then, he clears his throat and sings beautifully. The hook is people wanting to see the reaction on strangers faces when they find out that this guy can actually sing well. I don't think he would be able to go viral singing acapella in a parking garage without any hook. But by working a little harder on his format, he created an incredibly engaging piece of content. Whether or not you're the very best in the world, you should find a way to hook people in to watching what you have to offer. The next category is skits. Most of the time, this is where one person is playing multiple characters, playing out funny or relatable situations. Call me Chris is a perfect example of this, with over 11 million followers, pretending to be herself, her kid, her Russian neighbor, and her kids friends. This might feel uncomfortable, but a lot of the time, the worst acting or cringiest skits are the funniest, as long as they're built around a good concept. In my opinion, all of the best skits on the platform are deeply relatable. The goal is to find funny or interesting ways to relate to people on a deep level. If you're worried about what people are going to think, you can always start a new channel using a fresh email address and chances are, people aren't going to start seeing the videos until they're blowing up. At which point, they're not going to be embarrassing anymore. Think about your niche and whether they're skits that you could play out that would resonate with the people that you're trying to target. Next, let's talk about audience-generated concepts. This is where you use the community on the platform to inform your video concepts. A great example of this is Chef Gordon Ramsay. His best performing videos are reacting to people making cooking tiktoks. The same way that he would in one of his shows. He rips them apart and people love it. Another great example of this is a channel that gets their audience to comment with a dare that they want to see them do. Go to Olive Garden and don't say stop for the grated cheese. The ideas are relatable because they're done with businesses everybody knows. They're shareable because they're hilarious and repeatable because their audience leaves hundreds of comments with more ideas. Our honest ads channel takes brand suggestions from the audience and not only does it make brainstorming it easier for us, but it makes people feel involved in the creation of the video. Think about whether there's something related to your niche that you could do that your audience would prompt. Fake the first few by creating accounts and leaving the comments yourself and your audience will catch on pretty quick. For these videos, the comment is typically the hook. People need to know exactly what they're going to get and why it's worth watching. On a technical side, you can do this by replying to a comment with a video and posting it to your feed. Finally, I want to talk about trends and why my opinion is that you should mostly stay away from them. Unpopular opinion I know. When someone posts an amazing video that then becomes a trend, the first few people that you see copy it are awesome. It still feels fresh and original, but it's quickly followed by literally hundreds of thousands of people copying the exact same thing and now without the novelty of being first. While it is possible to do a trend in such a unique way that it shows your personality and develops an audience, those posts are honestly few and far between. My suggestion is to only use trends if you have a completely unique way of doing it that's different from everything else on the platform or if you're confident that you're one of the first people in a trend that you know is going to go viral. The biggest drawback for trends is you will start spending all of your time chasing the next one and pushing a square peg ground hole to relate it to your niche. My opinion is that if you can find the relatable, shareable, and repeatable idea, you're going to be so much more memorable than anyone chasing trends and trying to mimic something that they saw go viral. These are some of the formats that we consistently see doing the best on the platform and being familiar with each one will help you to find the ones that are going to be successful for you. As an activity, I want you to try to think of a video that you could create in each category. Create the hook on a little bit of a script for each one and see what excites you the most. Doing this can help lead you to the relatable, shareable, repeatable idea that is going to be rocket fuel for you on the platform.
