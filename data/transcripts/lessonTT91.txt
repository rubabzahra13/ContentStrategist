 In this lesson, I'm going to show you the three main strategies for getting customers and scaling on autopilot. You know the saying, build it and they will come? That is the worst possible advice for course creators. If you want your course to work, you need to find a way to get your offer in front of as many people as humanly possible and convince them it's worth their time, attention, and hard-earned dollars, which is exactly what we'll be talking about in this lesson. The first and my personal favorite way to sell a course is paid advertising. As I've said before, we've spent $5 million in the last year on ads and it's accounted for over 95% of our sales to get in 100,000 customers. I will say it can be risky. There's a real possibility you put in a thousand dollars to find out that either your ad, offer, or product aren't winners and it's time to hit the drawing board. But the risk can 100% be worth the reward because one great ad can keep making money for literally years. We have ads that were shot in four hours on an iPhone in our house that have made millions of dollars in sales and are still running today for literally the last year. The main reason ads are so powerful is the meta-ad algorithm. It's designed to reach people who actually want to buy your product. You know when you casually mention something to a friend and suddenly you're getting hit relentlessly with ads for that specific thing? That's because the ad algorithm is legendary at getting in front of the right people at the right time. The other perk of ads is you don't need an organic audience for them to work. When we started running ads we actually excluded anyone who had ever seen or interacted with anything we had ever created. This is because we knew that if someone only bought because they knew who we were, the offer would work for a couple weeks but as soon as we got through those people it would probably fail. So you don't need an audience at all to make it work. If you want to learn how to create great, high converting ads or how to run an ad campaign on meta, we have courses on both of those subjects that you can find out. We go in detail into everything from scripting to creation and our exact ad process that has allowed us to turn $1 into 2 over 5 million times in the last year. The next strategy for getting traffic is organic content. This means Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, anywhere that you can post organically and get your message in front of the right audience. The main benefit here is it's completely free. You can literally get hundreds of millions of views without ever spending a dime. Meaning it's absolutely no risk to you apart from your time. I know people that have also broken $10 million in a year with only organic content and no ads. But it does have a few downsides. The first is time. If all your sales come from organic content, you will need to be extremely consistent. Not all your videos are going to be home runs so you need to post enough to keep up with a consistent flow of traffic. The other challenge with organic is it's a bit harder to convert viewers into buyers. If ads you can be direct about what makes your product amazing, but that same messaging would flop in an organic post. You need to provide a ton of value that convinces people it's worth going through the link in your bio and paying money to learn even more from you. If you want to learn how to structure viral videos and get the most out of organic content, we have a course that teaches short form video for TikTok and Instagram Reels. We have students who have taken it and gotten over a billion views and used it to sell millions of dollars worth of products. If you want to check it out, there's a link in the description. The third main way that you can drive traffic and sales to your course is by convincing someone else to sell it to their audience, otherwise known as affiliate marketing. While this has been a small part of our strategy, there are course creators making millions through affiliate marketing alone. You can do this by creating an affiliate program in Kajalvi and deciding how much you want to give your affiliate partners. We give up to 50% and we've had small blogs do over $20,000 in sales. I will say usually the step comes later on after a course has had some success and can be pitched to people who have large audiences, but it's worth considering at any stage. One thing that has been absolutely key in all of our marketing is having at least one slam dunk home run case study. Someone who used the course to achieve the transformation that you're selling to potential customers. The turning point for us was when we had someone who was 60 years old and had never made a video in his life, take our course and get 10 million views in his first week creating content. People could say, well, if he can do it, so can I. I strongly recommend you get your course and as many hands as possible early on and give extra support or encouragement to help people get wins so you can start to create your library of testimonials. Those case studies are going to live in your ads, emails, landing pages, literally everywhere. So in summary, the main ways to get your first 100 or 100,000 customers is through ads or organic content. And if you need more support to make it happen, check out the links in the description where we've shared absolutely everything we know about both topics. And once you start creating a list of customers, you can scale further using email promotion and product launches. Remember, as long as you've created a quality course, people will want to learn from you again in the future. Try to help them continue their learning journey by creating more products that you think will improve their lives. In the next lesson, we'll be sharing how to refine your sales process and make 1% improvements until your offer is profitable enough to scale to the moon. Ready? Let's do it.
