 Imagine you're watching a movie, you're getting really into the plot, it's at the arc where the hero is in a high danger situation, and suddenly the main character changes into a different human and you're completely thrown out of the movie. What happened to my trustworthy character that maybe watched the movie in the first place? The person that I was rooting for, whose backstory inspired me? Well, that's what happens when your landing page doesn't match your creative. In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through the importance of making a cohesive customer journey from your ads or organic content to your landing page and how to make sure you nail it every time. So when you launch your creative, which is very important, ask yourself these three questions. Number one, is the subject matter in my creative relevant to my landing page? Let's say you're selling a product that has a team of 10 people behind the brand. The product is nail polish. So your creative is a founder story hero video and it goes into Jennifer's backstory of why she hated drugstore polish, all the bad ingredients within it, and how she set out to create a natural line of polish. As a viewer, I'm one minute into the ad and totally resonating with Jennifer. I'm really buying into the non-toxic angle. My curiosity is peaked and I click through, leaning toward buying. Then I land on a page and it's highlighting an influencer collab the nail polish brand recently did. Nelly Nails top five favorite shades this summer. There's a short blur about Nelly Nails and how she's a nail expert and I can trust she knows the season's trends. No Jennifer, no backstory, no non-toxic mission. Instead of seeing the familiar face I just connected with, I'm introduced to someone new. Now I'm confused, maybe even overwhelmed, so I click off and go right back to my social feed. So remember, the subject of your ad needs to be relevant to the landing page. 99% of the time. More on that later. Question number two, is the language of my landing page resonating with my creative? What tone brought in that customer click? It's probably the same tone that want to see continue on your landing page. Something I see a lot of marketers overlook is matching the tone of their creative to their landing page. Let's go back to Jennifer's nail polish brand. Maybe her ad gets super technical, she's in a lab talking about the harmful effects of toxic nail polish and creating urgency around switching. But when I land on the site, the tone completely changes. Suddenly it's Nelly again. The headline of the top says, did your toxic nail polish with your toxic X? It's cheeky, bold, maybe even fun, but it does not match the energy I just came from. Now I'm confused again. The language doesn't feel like it's speaking to me anymore. Even though I was sold a minute ago, I'm starting to hesitate. Question number three, does the overall experience of my landing page feel like a continuation of my creative? While design isn't the most important piece, it still plays a role in how your customer feels when they click through. A strong landing page keeps the same energy and clarity as your creative. The message lines up, the voice carries through, and it's obvious where to go next. This is where you want to get the customer across the finish line. Keep it simple and keep it easy for them to add to cart or directly purchase. So a good rule of thumb when you launch new creative, chances are you need to revisit your landing page because different creative angles often speak to different types of buyers or at the very least highlight different reasons to buy. Let's say one of your winning landing pages is a listicle, list and article. Titled five reasons people are switching to natural nail polish. That will probably work well with a UGC ad where someone genuinely talks about how much they love your specific nail polish brand without going into crazy detail about why natural is better. But if your new creative is a list style and that already walks through those five reasons and your landing page repeats them again, you're just getting redundant and losing the customer again. So instead, think of your creative and landing page as a flowing conversation. One that builds trust and looks like it's coming from the same voice or brand. I've attached a bonus checklist to help you gut check your landing pages before you start running traffic to them. You can find it in the lesson description. Speaking of traffic, now that your customers have a seamless experience from your ad to your landing page, it's time for the final lesson. Without this next step, your landing page will be useless because nobody will ever see it. Glenn is about to explain how you can get hundreds of thousands of people consistently and reliably visiting your page ready to buy. Yeglin!
