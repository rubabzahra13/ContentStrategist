 In this course, we're going to be teaching you the essentials to get started with running ads on meta so you can learn how to scale without losing sleep or losing your shirt. Paying for ads can often feel like sliding money under a locked door and crossing your fingers that someone slides even more back. And while that's not far from the truth, we're going to give you the tools to be confident that that money will slide back your way. We'll be focusing primarily on meta because as of now, it's still the most reliable and consistent platform as well as the easiest to get started. But that said, most of the principles we cover do apply no matter what platform you're running ads on. So, let's get into it. Before we get started, you might be wondering what makes us qualified to teach the course. And the truth is, we're not. Let me explain. In 2023, we spent our first real dollar on ads. We'd been a video production business for almost a decade and this was the first penny we had ever spent on advertising so we were terrified. It genuinely felt like we were throwing money into a pit. But day one, we spent $30 and got $160 sale. A big win. That meant we had $60 to spend on day two. We kept going this way until we were able to run about $1000 a day consistently and get $2000 back. While that felt like a big accomplishment, it was at that point that we went for coffee with our old friend, Navid. Navid founded one of the largest media buying agencies in the country, where he ran hundreds of millions of dollars in ads for massive global companies. He had been a mentor to us for years and we were eager for the day to come when he would be excited to team up with us on a project. So, when we told him what we were doing and he wanted to talk through it with us, we were pumped. After going through our ad account for about an hour, Navid sat back and told us that if we wanted, he could help us get to spending $20,000 a day at the same profit margins within a few months. Our minds were blown. All he needed was 60 minutes with our account to have absolute confidence that he could spend over $6 million a year on ads for our $60 digital product and get double that in return. Needless to say, the following months we were relentless with picking his brain to understand how he did it and how we could learn to do the same. Fortunately for us, Navid is one of the kindest, most intelligent and most generous people we have ever met and he was happy to share everything he knew. We realized that he gave us the keys to one of the most powerful wealth building tools of the 21st century. While it's only a piece to the overall puzzle made up of a great product, great offer and great ads, it was a piece that was absolutely crucial and that the majority of people get horribly wrong. So in this course, we'll be sharing the keys and giving you his answers to the countless questions that we had about what he saw in that first 60 minutes with our ad account as well as what he would do if he was starting from square one with a new brand. While we'll be the ones talking throughout this course, everything has been edited and revised by the man behind the magic and he'll be making an appearance later on to help you set up your first ad with a live lesson inside of a brand new ads manager account. So what exactly are you going to learn throughout this course? First of all, we're going to be going through the terms that are essential to know when getting into ads. Running your first ad can be overwhelming because you're faced with acronyms and terms that have no meaning without explanation. Understanding the language of media buying will build the foundation that the rest of this course rests on. Next, we're going to simplify the entire process of media buying. If you've run ads before, I want you to forget everything you know and go into this lesson as a blank slate. There are so many misconceptions that cost people literally millions of dollars running ads or even stop an account from being able to get off the ground in the first place. In the last decade, the tools for media buying have become so unbelievably advanced that your main job as a media buyer is to take a step back and know when to let the algorithms doing billions of calculations a minute do the work for you. After that, we'll be answering the most common questions in media buying. How much do I spend and how do I know when I can spend more? We'll be giving you a bullet proof framework to get started and knowing you can increase spend or scale to the moon. No matter how good you get at media buying, there are always hiccups and roadblocks. So in the next lesson, we'll be going over crisis management. I'll show you the most common issues that can arise and how to handle them without losing your cool or worse your account. Once we've covered the game plan, Navid will be running you through how to set up your first ad within meta. This is a live lesson inside the dashboard of a brand new account so you can set up your first ad like a pro. Then once you have the ads running, I'll be giving you our tracking spreadsheet. Since no ad platform has perfect tracking, it's important to keep your own spreadsheet with the most important data. This will help you to have a more clear picture of how the ads are doing. This spreadsheet will also give you goals and milestones to aim for while running your campaigns. Finally, we'll be finishing off with a media buying challenge to help you get your account off the ground. But before you dive into this course, you have some homework. If you haven't already set up your ad account, it's time to do that now. Meta makes this process incredibly simple and as frictionless as possible because obviously they want your money. But I've dropped a link in the lesson description that will take you through how to get started on ad's manager. Follow the steps they lay out from connecting your Facebook and Instagram accounts to making sure that your account is verified. If you run into any trouble along the way, I recommend googling the exact issue that you're having because I guarantee there are forums of people who have run into the exact same problem and have found a simple solution. All right, I don't know about you, but I am absolutely fired up to get started and share the skills that have completely changed our lives because I know that they can have the same impact on you. So let's dive in.
