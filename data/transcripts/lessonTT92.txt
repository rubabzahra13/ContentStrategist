 Welcome to the final lesson in this course. At this point, we've shown you how to land on your idea, create your offer, produce your course, and the methods that you can use to get customers. The next step of the journey is to make as many 1% improvements as you possibly can. Chances are you're not going to come out of the gate getting hundreds of customers every single day on autopilot. So what are the things that you can do to make your product, offer, and sales systems better? First off, for the first six months at least, you should always be running A-B tests to your landing page at any given moment. Start by testing different header tags, then once you have a clear winner, get rid of the loser and start a new A-B test. You can do these tests right inside of Kajabi using their landing page A-B testing feature. We have done hundreds of these tests, and sometimes it makes no difference to the CPA or cost to acquire a customer, but sometimes it can make a 20% difference, which at scale is the difference between millions of dollars. I once heard an interview with Russell Brunson where he said that this is the only job in the world where you can wake up feeling inspired, do 10 minutes of work, and make an extra million dollars this year as a result, and it couldn't be more true. My biggest advice here is to never trust your gut. I used to be a graphic designer, so I thought our website had to be beautiful and covered in sleek graphics, but someone convinced me to try testing a massive block of ugly text, and guess what? It performed 20% better than what was there before. You should be willing to try absolutely anything if there's data that it could be an improvement. Here's a quick list of tests that we've run to our landing page that I definitely recommend you try. First, the header text. Again, this will have the largest impact on conversion by a long shot. Next, background color. Video versus no video, as well as the video length. The length of copy for the above-ass section, how you break up your value stack, or the list of what's included when you purchase, payment plan, versus no payment plan, and try testing different discounts to see what performs best. Another big thing to test is your audience. When we first started our TikTok and Instagram course, we thought our audience would be people who wanted to quit their jobs and make money from their hobbies. So that's what the ads were focused on. But we started getting people from all walks of life, from business owners to board retirees, to social media managers for companies. So we shifted our marketing from make money from your hobbies to start getting millions of views. And by widening our net, we were able to attract hundreds more customers every day. When it comes to your ads or content promoting the course, there are a ton of ways to test and make 1% changes. For us, these improvements mostly came from the comments we got. For example, if you get comments saying there's no way it actually works, it means that you need to add more social proof. If you get a ton of comments saying that it's too expensive, you should either test different prices, or find a way to make it feel more valuable. If you're not getting any comments at all, maybe you haven't given people a good enough reason to care about the offer. Finally, let's address the elephant in the room. What do you do if you've tried all of the 1% improvements you can think of? You've worked as hard as you possibly can on all of your ads and your funnel, but you're still not getting sales. That means it might be time to look at your offer and whether it's good enough for people to spend harder on dollars on it. If you find yourself in that boat, don't get discouraged. We were in that boat once too, and we very nearly threw in the towel. But we knew that we could do it, so we doubled down. We turned off the tap to the business that we had so that we could focus on the business that we wanted and making it work. I'm not saying that's what you should do because everyone's journey is different. What we did was honestly a pretty dumb business move at the time, and we took some huge chances that ended up paying off. But you need to do what's right for you, and remember that you can't lose if you don't give up. Now we've gone over all of the systems and strategies that we use to scale our course to eight figures, but there's one thing that I want you to remember that's more important than any of the lessons in this course. Remember the very beginning we told you about our friend who had made a million dollars from selling a course and how it inspired us to get started on our journey? If it weren't for that friend, we wouldn't be here. He shared his numbers, his systems, and he made it all feel real and possible. Above everything else that we've taught, that's what I want you to take away from this. We are completely normal people. We were working 80 hours a week on a business that frustrated us like crazy, and we took a chance on launching a course. It's been a long road, but it's paid off a million times over because we could see the light at the end of the tunnel and we persisted through the challenges. More than anything, I hope that this course has inspired you to see what's possible, and that it's made this journey feel real and attainable. So with that, I'd like to wish you the absolute best of luck, and we cannot wait to see what you create.
