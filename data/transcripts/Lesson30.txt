 What's up? Now that you've got Premiere installed, let's get ready to get you to acquainted. Ready to meet your new best friend? In this lesson, I'll be giving you a brief overview of Adobe Premiere, including understanding the user interface, setting up an ideal editing window, your basic timeline settings, installing keyboard shortcuts, and exporting your video. Having an understanding of how Premiere functions and how to set it up as efficiently as possible, will ensure you're comfortable and confident as you start on your first project. You can also use this video as a playbook to refer back to if you ever run into any issues within the app. Let's get to work. Welcome to the editing station. Let's get into it. As you can see, I'm now a tiny box in the corner of your screen, and I want you to remember that I'll always be in your corner. All right, now's a bad joke. Let's keep moving. Before we even jump into Premiere, we're going to start by offloading all of that footage that you just captured. And that all starts in a project folder. I want you to open your finder window and create a new folder for your project. In this case, we're going to be using a TikTok We Just Shot for our Honest Ads channel as an example. So I'm going to label my project fast food, jump into that folder, and then from here, we're going to be opening a new window so we can offload all of the footage that we just shot. So I'm going to go command in, that's going to open up a new window. And then you'll probably be pulling this from either your phone or a camera. If you're using a phone, you can just air drop it. If you're using a camera, you're probably pulling off an SD card. So it's in our Honest Ads folder from this hard drive, fast food. I'm going to be taking it from this hard drive, and I just drag and drop right into this project folder. So there you have it. You have a project folder with all of your clips. I like to keep things tidy, so clean up by kind, date modified, whatever floats your vote. So now that you have this created, you have all your clips in here, we're going to take it one step further with the organization. This will help a lot further on down the road as you're editing to keep you organized. So from here, I'm going to make a new folder and just title it phone because this is where all of our phone footage will live. Keep it neat and tidy. The reason we do this is because eventually we'll have multiple folders. One for phone footage, maybe one for some additional stock clips, one for audio, one for music, and having a folder system, just make sure everything always stays organized and you know exactly where things are going to be when you have to go back later on. Now that we understand that, let's open up Premiere. The very first time you open this app, it's probably going to feel a little bit daunting. This is essentially your project manager screen. As you can see, I have recent projects on here. You won't have that. It's probably just going to show you some type of tutorial, which you don't need to take because you're doing that right now. So we're going to start by selecting new project from the top left corner. I always start by tidling mine, which we already know is going to be called fast food. And then from there, you're going to select the project location. This is what we just discussed. So choose location. We put it in projects and we put it in fast food. Cheers. What this does is it saves your project to the exact same folder where all of the footage is. So if you have to come back and say, edit something a couple months down the road, you know everything's going to be living in the same spot and you don't have to go on a goose chase to find anything, which is a system that actually took us some time to implement and caused a lot of unnecessary stress. So doing it this way will have you set up properly from the very beginning. Now that we have all that set up, all you need to do is hit create. And that is going to open your very first premiere window. Now this looks a little confusing. So let's figure it out. So this is currently set up in our ideal editing window, which is how I want you guys to set yours up as well. But I'm going to walk you through how to do that step by step. So we're going to start by going up here to window. You're going to go into workspaces and then you're going to go into editing. Chances are you are probably already looking at a window similar to this. So this is going to be our basis to get started. We're going to start with our project window, which is the very first window you'll be dealing with. We're going to select that and drag it up to the top left corner. You'll see the bar on the side highlight and when it does that, you know you can drop it and replace. So the project window is essentially where all of your footage and all of your media will live. So any sound effects, any visual effects, any music that you decide to drag in will live in this section of the screen. So now that we have this project window placed where we want it, we're going to go ahead and import the footage that we just store. To do that, you hit command i. You can also drag and drop. I'm going to show you the command i option first. We're going to go over to projects on the left hand side and we're going to open our most recent projects. From there, I'm just going to select the entire phone folder and hit import. Congratulations. That's step one. So now that you've imported all of your phone footage into your project, you can just double click on that folder and as you see, everything will just be living in this project window. The next window that I want to talk about that you'll be using next is called the source window. In order to move to the source window, you can just select the first clip that you'll be looking at, double click on it, and then that will automatically appear in your source window. You use this window to navigate through your footage and decide which parts of the clip you're going to use in the main video. For now, I'm just going to take a very small clip and put it in what's called the timeline. Before we can actually put anything in the timeline, we have to know what our project settings are going to be. To do that, scroll up to file, go to new, and go to sequence. I would suggest going to R8 1080, 23.976, and then we'll adjust there to fit your frame size. This is just going to be the most compatible across the board. So you don't have to worry too much about the technicalities. I'm going to title the sequence, main edit, and then from there, we'll move over to the settings. So as you can see, currently it says it's 1920 by 1080 or 16 by 9. That's your standard viewing for anything like YouTube, TV, film, but because we're doing this specifically for social media, we're just going to change those settings around and make it 1080 by 1920 or 9 by 16. That's the only thing that you need to change in this field, and then if you want to, you can save the preset so you don't have to do this again moving forward. To do that, you just select save preset and name it main edit again. That way next time you start a project and you need a new sequence, you can just scroll down to custom and select your sequence settings, and that's going to be pretty much what you use for any of your vertical videos. Okay, now you can see that we have a timeline window down here. Now this is where you're going to be doing all of your main editing. Everything you do as you piece this video together will happen in this timeline window. So I'm going to show you the first step in that. You're going to select this video from your source window, simply click on it, hold down your cursor, drag it in, and release. Now you have video and audio in your timeline window. As you can see, there's multiple different tracks on the top and bottom. These ones being titled V1, V2, V3, and then the same underneath A1, A2, A3. What these are is video and audio tracks. So as your dragging files in, if it's video, it's going to live in a video track. And if it's audio, it's going to live in an audio track. There's your timeline window. As you build your video out in the timeline, it's going to be piece together so you can watch it through in this main video window here or program main edit. As you can see right now, there's a lot of dead unused space in either side of this clip. So I'm going to arrange this to get the most out of this editing window. What I'm going to do is drag this window to the right of the screen, until we see this bar and then drop it. Now we have a lot more real estate where we can see our finished video come together. Obviously, this just mixed things up a little bit, so we're going to tweak that in. Start by grabbing this bar and sliding it all the way to the right pretty much until you run out of dead space on either side and it starts to shrink a little bit. Now what you're left with is your source window above an audio here. Your audio window does not need to be this big, so you can also drag that until you can just barely see the levels, which is this bar here. From here, you can also shrink your project window because you don't need to be seeing that many clips at the same time. So drag that all the way over until you see just one row of clips is how I generally like to do it. This is the main window that we use to edit all of our vertical projects. So once you have it set up like this, I would suggest going up to window, work spaces, and save as new workspace. We can title this vertical one. Okay, now that we have our main editing setup, I'm going to walk you through each window and what it's used for. We're going to start by going back to our project window. The first step as you're editing is always going to be in your project window. So now as you see, we already have our one clip in the timeline. If you scroll to the end of this, the next clip that I want to add in is going to be of a tight on the burger in her hand. So I'll go back over to my project window. There's the clip there. Take out what I want. Good keyboard shortcuts for this are I to select your end point or the starting point of the video. Let that play for a second with the space bar and then oh, to select the out point. From there, I can grab this clip and drag it down either on top of or replace that clip. For now, I'm going to put it on top. So from there, I don't actually need the audio clip that's attached to that. So if I hold down option and just select that one clip by clicking on it, I can now delete that clip and remove it. Alternatively, what I could have done in this instance is only select the video layer from this source window. As you can see at the bottom of the screen, there's a video or audio option. So what would have been better in this situation is just selecting the video and dragging that down. Then you don't even need to delete the audio. So now you have an understanding of the project and source windows. This is how you're going to piece together the main structure, which is going to play as your final video in the right hand side here. Boom, tied on the burger. Now we can get into what all the additional windows do. I'm just going to walk you through a window by window. So starting from the source, we already understand what that does. Let's move over to effect controls. This is one that you're going to be using for every single video that you ever do. So now that we have this clip selected here in the timeline and we go into effect controls, you can see everything listed here. So position, pretty self explanatory. If you drag this, it's going to position your clip within the frame. So there's an x-axis and a y-axis. In order to just revert to the original, there's this button here that just says reset parameter and you'll get it perfectly centered again. Underneath that, we have a scale option. So this is to make your video either larger or smaller. Again, pretty self explanatory reset parameters. You also have rotation, opacity, which is going to make your clip either more or less transparent. And those are the main basic functions of the effect window. From there, we'll move over to essential graphics. This window is typically used if you're implementing any kind of shapes or text over top of your video. I'll quickly show you how that would look by keyboard shortcut T for text. And then once you have that, you can click on the actual video. And as you can see now, our graphics window has popped up. So let's just type burger. Now you can see we have this text over top of our main video screen. And you'll edit that within this graphics window. So if I select the burger, I can go down here to pick which font I want. Solom. Why not? Burger, nice little retro font, kind of cool. Looks a little bit off-centered. Don't really like how it looks. That's easy to fix. Align horizontally and align vertically. It's going to perfectly center your image. Or if you don't want it aligned that way, you can align left and align right. So that's how you position your text. Alternatively, you can also use these same parameters and get it exactly where you want it to be. So there's a lower third for you. Within this window, you'll have options for moving your text, styling your text, curing your text, and also changing the appearance with things like a stroke, a background, or a shadow. Okay, I'm going to delete that because we don't actually want the burger text on it. From there, let's move over to essential sound. So right now, only one of our clips has audio on it. And that is this very first one that we have. So what the essential sound window is used for is essentially just cleaning up or balancing or adding effects to your audio. In this case, we want it to just be pretty clean and understandable audio. So I'm going to go into dialogue. And then under preset, we can just say balanced female voice. This is a good starting point to just clean up and level out your audio. From there, there's all kinds of options that you can get into like reducing noise, adding reverb, and doing all kinds of different unique presets like on the telephone over the radio. But these are probably things that are a little bit advanced that you don't need to worry about right off the bat. Let's move over to the next window, Lumetri Color. This one is also pretty self explanatory. It's used to color your video. You can accomplish most of the color correction that you need to right here in this basic correction window. Anything outside of that gets a little bit more advanced and isn't really necessary for social media. So within this window, you can see things like temperature. We can make her warmer or cooler. The tint, which is more magenta or more green. Saturation. More or less. And then it gets down into more specifics like exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, and blacks. You should be able to use this to fine tune your color and give it that little extra pop that you're looking for. The next window after that is the audio clip mixer. And what we can do is right click and close that panel and never think about it again. We don't use it. Those are the main effects windows that you'll use as you piece your video together. Speaking of effects, we're now going to move down to the bottom left corner. Any effects that you're going to put on your video clips will be found here. I'll walk you through one that we use fairly regularly. It's called warp stabilizer and it's used to stabilize clips. So all you have to do, type it in, grab, and drop onto your video. From there, it'll automatically start analyzing and then anything you need to adjust will be back in our effects controls window. So as you can see now that we've put some color on the video, that's in the effects window. And if you scroll down, you'll find the effect that we just put on called warp stabilizer. What this does is it just stabilizes the shot if there's any handheld shakiness or any kind of jumps in the video. The smoother the footage you start with, the better of a job this does. And then underneath warp stabilizer, you'll find all of your functions. So there's different ways to warp it and different levels of smoothness that you can do. What I find works very well for most footage is just saying position scale rotation and only put it in at about 15%. It's a lot more subtle that way. So as you can see, it didn't really do a great job on that. I'm already happy with how stable that clip is, so we're just going to delete that. But now you know how it works. In that same window, you'll also find things like metadata, media browser, and libraries. We don't use any of those. You'll essentially just use this as your effect finder window. Those are the absolute basics on how to set up and use Premiere and it might still be a little bit confusing. But in the next lesson, we're going to take everything that you just learned here and work through step by step how to take your project from start to finish. That's it. This may have felt a little overwhelming. I know it did when I first started learning seven years ago. I remember getting frustrated and stuck countless times and having to spend hours watching Adobe tutorials and reading user forums to figure the basics out. Hopefully with the knowledge you gained from this video, you have a foundation to begin learning the program. And as long as you keep at it, you'll grow to be 100 times faster than you are today. I promise. With that said, let's start practicing now. It's time to edit your video. I'll see you in the next lesson.
