 You've heard us mention Heroads in this course a few times already. In this lesson, we're taking a deep dive into what a Heroad actually is and why they are so important to your ad account. So first, let's address the name. Why is it called a Heroad? This term was originally thrown around early in my career, and although not the textbook title, it's when I've held onto over the years and even introduced to other marketers and clients I take on. It's an ad that's evolved with the digital market and has taken on its own unique form that we've now officially defined. Heroad. A single evergreen video created with the intention of taking potential customers from the top of funnel cold awareness stage all the way through to the bottom of funnel conversion stage. Yes, this is the ad that turns your unknowing audience into paying customers. That's what makes it a hero. Now, let's learn how to make one. If your ad account is looking like a graveyard of failing creative, imagine your Heroad is the evergreen story that transforms your business bottom line to this. It tells the story of your brand, product, or service in a nicely packaged couple of minutes and has to contain every single element of a great ad that we discussed earlier in Module 1. To recap, those elements are a hook, problem, solution, value props, social proof or credibility, reminder of benefits, and call to action. Heroads come in all shapes and sizes, and I have some great examples to put all of this into context. Before we dive in, let's take a look at our fancy edutainment scale to make this super clear. Education on one end, entertainment on the other. Every ad that's ever existed has fallen somewhere on this scale. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. Whether it's a Heroad or UGC, aka user-generated content, try to aim here. But for now, let's focus on the Heroad, because it may be the most important ad you create for your business. Keep in mind, this will be your main evergreen ad, so yes, it'll take effort, but also, yes, it will be worth it. Meaning it could theoretically live in your ad account for many years. It doesn't consist of TikTok trends, seasonal offers, or limited edition products or services. The goal is to scale, so it should have core messaging that's going to resonate with someone this winter, the same way it'll resonate next summer. It does consist of the seven core elements.
