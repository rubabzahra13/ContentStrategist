 Now that we've defined who you're going to be selling to, it's time to discuss how you're going to position your offer. This isn't always done at an ad level, but it's usually the next thing your customer will see after watching the ad. So it's important that all of your messaging feels cohesive, and your ad is preparing them for your offer. Offer creation is the art and science of packaging a product or service in a way that feels irresistible to your audience. It's not just about what you're selling, but how you sell it. So how do we create a killer offer that customers literally can't say no to? We need to clearly communicate overwhelming value. It needs to feel so obviously incredible that your customer would be tossing and turning, losing sleep if they turned it down. And maybe even having nightmares. To do that, we just need to follow a simple formula. So let's create your offer. To develop your irresistible offer, you have to start by understanding what makes your product or service unique, which requires a deep understanding of your customer journey, their pain points and objections, and how you can solve their problems. So it's a good thing we just covered all that in the last couple lessons. Without information, fresh in our mind, let's break this down into three steps that will be the foundation of our offer. For this process, I'm going to be using Amazon Prime as an example because they've created one of the best no-brainer offers of all time. Step number one is to define the core problem your customer is facing. This should be the most painful problem your product or service can solve. For Amazon, they knew their customers didn't want to wait two weeks for their order to arrive and spend an extra $50 for shipping every single time. Step number two is to deeply understand who your customer is and what they need. In Amazon's case again, their customer was a digital shopper. These are people who enjoy online shopping for its simplicity, the fact they can find absolutely everything in one location, and the instant gratification of wanting something and getting it immediately. Step number three is to analyze and understand your competition. What are you going to offer your customers that your competitors aren't willing or able to? With Amazon Prime, you could receive your order within 24 hours, faster than anybody else in the entire industry. Now that we have our foundation, we're going to break down the actual components of an irresistible offer. First is a clear value proposition. This is a simple statement that explains how your product or service solves a problem in a way that no other can. It should be short, clear, and compelling. In Amazon's case, it would look like this. Free, unlimited, one-day delivery on millions of items to most cities and towns. No minimum purchase required. Another great example comes from a brand called FiberFix and looks like this. FiberFix Repair Tape is 100 times stronger than duct tape and softer than nothing. 100 times stronger than the strongest tape commonly known to humankind is a very clear and simple value prop. PS, if you've never seen one of their ads, I've linked one in the lesson description. It's titled Redneck Drives a Duck Tape Car Off A Cliff. I think you're going to love it. Next is the Risk Reversal Or Guarantee. This involves removing any financial risk for the customer. Hesitation Overcost is one of the biggest objections you'll face with your audience. So if you can totally remove that fear, it makes the offer a thousand times more compelling. Money-back guarantees and free trial periods are classic examples of risk reversal. Having a guarantee can feel really scary. The thought of giving people their money back and having to cover those additional costs is... pretty uncomfortable. But we've found that as long as you have a great product, a guarantee will actually reduce your refund rate. With Amazon Prime, customers can cancel their membership anytime. So there's no long-term financial risk. Another great example of risk reversal comes from the late visionary and CEO of Zappos, Tony Shea. Zappos, an online shoe store based out of Las Vegas, was facing bankruptcy in the early 2000s. That's when Tony decided to try a revolutionary approach to customer service. They offered free shipping both ways and a 365-day return policy. It was an offer that was absolutely unheard of in the e-commerce space and met with a ton of resistance. But Tony's goal was to make shopping online at Zappos as risk-free as possible. He understood that customers were hesitant to buy shoes online because they couldn't try them on first. So he decided to mimic the in-store experience by allowing customers to order multiple sizes or styles, try them on at home, and return what they didn't want without any hassle or cost. The result of this offer was incredible. Not only did it improve the customer experience and build crazy brand trust, but it also resulted in a massive revenue boost. Because so many shoppers decided they actually wanted to keep all of the pairs of shoes they ordered. This ultimately saved Zappos from bankruptcy, leading to a billion dollar acquisition by Amazon several years later. That is the power of risk reversal. Next is urgency and scarcity. These elements compel action. Flash sales are one of the absolute best examples here. We introduced a Black Friday sale for our TikTok and Reels creator course back in 2023, and it increased conversions and profits so much that we've been running some type of sale every single day since then. We just re-word the sale to fit the season. Having a 24 hour sale creates tension on the customer and encourages them to take immediate action or risk losing out on savings. For Amazon, they run yearly prime days and big deal days for their members where you can save exponentially within a limited window of time. In 2024, prime days did a record breaking $14.2 billion in revenue. Another way to create urgency if you don't want to offer a discount on your product is by including gifts or added benefits for a limited time. This is something you'll see banks do quite often and it can look like this. Get a $350 Visa gift card when you open a new checking account until the end of this month. Regardless of how you instill urgency and scarcity, it's a must for creating a powerful offer. Next up is bonuses. I briefly touched on these as a way to create scarcity, but bonuses are where you can enhance the perceived value of your core offer with additional items that really sweeten the deal. Oftentimes you'll see brands create bundles where they throw in additional items at drastically reduced costs to really give one last push that convinces the customer this deal is just too good to pass up on. On top of unlimited same day delivery, Amazon Prime members get access to a massive library of music and video content including exclusive Amazon originals as well as some of the biggest blockbusters and most popular shows in the world. If this wasn't already enough, they often include a free Alexa for new members. Wow, I'm really talking about Amazon. You're welcome, Bezos. You've probably also seen bonuses at restaurants where kids under 6 feet free or free dessert when you order two meals and an api. There are a ton of fun ways to offer bonuses in a way that doesn't affect your bottom line. So try to have fun with this and ask yourself how you could sweeten the deal for your customers so they simply cannot refuse. I mean, who could say no to free dessert? Lastly, we have a clear call to action or CTA. This is the most important element of your offer.
