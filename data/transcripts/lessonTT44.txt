 Over the last decade, I've spent literally thousands of hours inside the software that I'm going to teach you today. So I'm going to give you a crash course into all of the things that not only are going to make you a faster, more efficient editor, but are also going to keep people watching for longer. Now this is a software that is used in Hollywood for some of the biggest blockbusters in the world, and it is also completely free for pretty much everything you could possibly need. So let's get into it. Before we dive into DaVinci, step one is obviously downloading the program. So you're going to search DaVinci Resolve in Google, and it's going to bring you to this page right here. You're going to scroll down to free download now. Click on that. DaVinci Resolve 19 is the free version, and I suggest downloading that if you're just getting started, pretty much everything that you need is going to be in there, but there are a few features we'll go over some later in this video that you will need DaVinci Resolve Studio for, which you can get for, I think it's under $300 US, and I promise it will pay itself off if you decide to go that route. But for now, let's download DaVinci Resolve 19. Obviously, Mac, Windows, download what's right for you. Now once you have that downloaded, we are going to open up DaVinci Resolve. When you open DaVinci Resolve, it's going to take you to this page here, which is going to have all of your projects listed out. For you, this will be your first project, so you're going to be hitting Untitled Project here, and it's going to go to this page. And the very first thing that we're going to do is we're going to scroll all the way out, and then go to the top, we're going to click Keyboard, Customization, and go to the three dots at the top right hand corner. When you click on that, you'll see a setting that says Import Preset. You're going to click that, and in the downloads for this lesson, there's a file called FYP, underscore DaVinci, underscore shortcuts, hit Import Preset, and select that file on your computer. Now this is going to work whether you're on Mac or PC. The biggest difference is just Command on a Mac is the same as Control on a PC. Option on a Mac is the same as Alt on a PC, and Control on a Mac is the same as Command on a PC. Once you have those shortcuts imported, you're going to hit Save for me. They're already in there, so I'm just going to hit Close, and it's very importantly you do this step because we are going to be using these keyboard shortcuts throughout the tutorial. Let me give you a quick little overview of what you're looking at here. This is the main tab that you're going to be using today. This is the Edit tab. This is where you're going to be combining all your clips and where your timeline is going to live. The other two tabs that we are this one here, which is this Color Wheel. As the name suggests, is where we're going to be coloring our footage. And finally, this rocket ship down here is where you're going to be exporting the final video. So let's go back to the Edit tab here and dive right in. Step one is getting your footage from your phone or camera onto your computer. So usually I will use airdrop to do that. If you're not using a Mac, I would also recommend using Google Drive or we transfer to get the footage from your phone onto your computer. We're going to be editing an ad that we shot a while ago that we call our For the Girls ad. So what we're going to do is I'm going to take all of my video clips and I'm going to just drag them into this section here. We're going to hit Change and all of these will pop up right here. If this window isn't coming up for you, just click on Media Pool and it's going to show up right in the top left. Right now mine are in a list, but you can click this button here to turn them into icons so that you can see a bit more clearly what you're looking at. This is the fun part. You probably went into your video shoot with a script. So you're going to pull out that script and what we're going to do is we're just going to start to place out all of our shots. Before we start putting any of our shots into the timeline, what we're going to do because this is a vertical video is we're going to go to the very bottom. We're going to click on this gear right here and we're going to hit Use Vertical Resolution. So what this does is it changes it from landscape to vertical. Super important. Hit Save. So what we're going to do is we're going to double click on the first clip that's going to be in our video. Now this bar lets us drag around and we're going to cut to the very beginning of the shot. For us this is going to be right before Meg talks and we're going to hit the letter I. What this does is it sets an in point for your clip, meaning that when you click I, that is where your clip is going to start. Then we're going to hit Space. That's where the clip is going to end and we're going to hit Oh. So to pick what part of the clip you want to use, you're going to hit I for the beginning and Oh for the end. That's the in point and the out point. From there, click on the image and drag it into your timeline below here. So you'll see that this drags both the video and the audio clip. If you wanted to just pull the video, you can see that there's this icon and that would just pull the video component and same thing with the audio. Now we're just going to take all of our clips and we're going to lay them out in the order that we want them. I'm just going to save you a little bit of time.
