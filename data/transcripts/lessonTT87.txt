 In this lesson, I'm going to lay out the steps of our funnel from add to landing page and course to future purchases. The ultimate goal here is to make the experience as frictionless for your customer as humanly possible. When we first launched our course, it was way too complicated. Someone saw our ad, went to a page where they opted into our email list, they got a free resource, then we sent them emails with webinars and training videos, and finally created urgency to buy the course at the end of a 7-day email sequence. So many steps. That's what we saw most people online doing, so we thought it was the only way. But then, just out of curiosity, we tried running an ad straight to a sales page. And our profit doubled. By adding more steps in our funnel, we were actually creating more friction to the buying experience and making people less likely to become a student. Imagine going to buy a t-shirt and needing to provide all of your info, fill out an application, and be forced to watch a video about how the shirt was made before even being asked to buy. You're probably going to decide you didn't want the shirt that bad to begin with, and you're going to go find one somewhere else. The one important note is you need to be able to communicate the value of your product extremely clearly in the ad, landing page, and check out page for this to make sense. The two reasons that you might want to add more steps to your sales process is either A, you're selling something high ticket that requires a lot more convincing, or B, there's no way to make the products simple enough to understand from one landing page alone. But if that's the case, you should probably simplify your offer, or it's going to be an uphill battle to begin with. Before we get into our customer journey, an important note is you want to keep the brand coherent between every step of the funnel. For example, the colors, tone, fonts, and brand should feel coherent between ad, landing page, check out, and course. Something as simple as a consistent color will help people feel confident that they're being led down the right path through the entire customer journey. Okay, without further ado, here is our seven step sales process. Step one, it starts with an ad. We try to do as much of the selling as possible in this stage. If we can communicate the value of our product and get customers really excited about it, there's a good chance that they'll be looking for a buy now button as soon as they finish the ad. When it comes to ads, you pay the same amount of money for someone to see a five-second video as a three-minute video. So in my opinion, while you have their attention, you should take them on a ride that they'll actually remember. I could talk literally all-day-a-bow ads, but we have an entire course on creating ads that actually convert. If you want to check it out, we've put a link in the lesson description for you, and I definitely suggest it because it has been the biggest driver for us to get to 100,000 students in the last year. Step two, next, they go to our landing page. This is where you share the offer as clearly and concisely as possible. We include tons of social proof from previous students, a long, about us section for people to see our credibility and inspiration for creating the product, as well as exactly what they're going to get when they buy. We also love having a video sales letter or VSL at the top of the page. This is a video that explains who you are and what makes your product amazing. It's not totally necessary, but we do love to have it. If you want to dive deeper into landing page creation, we have a mini course that dives into everything from layout to landing page copywriting. I'll put a link to it in the lesson description as well. Step three, after that, they go to the check out page. Here, we reiterate the important points and we give the option to buy a smaller order bump. We do this with a checkbox below the check out to add a product to their order. This should be something fairly inexpensive and easy to sell to somebody within a few words, but don't underestimate this order bump. We've had over 40,000 people click that checkbox and add a $15 product to their order. I'll let you do the math on that. You are leaving a lot on the table if you're not doing that. Step four, next, they get sent through a couple of upsells for similar products. These should be products that are different, but complementary to the thing that they just bought. For example, our course on how to create hack andverting ads has an upsell for how to manage an ad campaign inside of meta. Step five, after that, they get sent to a thank you page where they can log in and start watching the course. Some people add another sell on the thank you page, but we find that feels like a bit too much. Step six, for the next seven days, we have an email sequence where we send customers valuable tips and tricks to get the most out of the course. We also use it as an opportunity to share other student wins to increase their odds of taking action on the course, and we share other products that are relevant. And finally, step seven, after all that, they get put into our regular email list where we send weekly value emails and updates. Meg's going to dive into the email strategy later in this course. So stay tuned for that. From this regular email list, we'll also share new product launches, student wins, and affiliate partnerships. Simplicity is the name of the game when it comes to your funnel because at the moment, people are confused, they're gone. Even if you're running a webinar freebie or selling a $7 product to try to sell people on something higher ticket down the road, you're going to want to make the process as simple and frictionless as humanly possible. In the next lesson, we're going to be taking you into the back end of our kajabi account so you can see how we actually set up all of these steps inside our funnel. If you haven't already, go sign up for kajabi so you can follow along. I will leave a discount link in the description and con. We'll see you in the next one.
