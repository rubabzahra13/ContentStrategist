 Congratulations! You have made it to the final module in this course, the release. We are so proud of all of the hard work you have put in so far. We hope you've gained so much more confidence as a creator through learning about creative mindset, storytelling, planning, and of course creating. Now it's time to wrap things up by quickly sharing some tips to get your video out into the world. In this short module, we are going to cover two key areas. Launch and persistence. In our launch lesson, we're going to walk through the four phases we have adopted here at One Peak, which has helped us get the most of every single video we release. This recipe for success was developed after a lot of trial and error when launching our own content. So we hope it can fast track you to becoming a better launcher. Then we're going to chat about the importance of persistence and how this superpower is going to bring your career soaring to new heights. This just might be our favorite lesson in the entire course and we hope you find it as valuable as we do. But enough chit chat, let's do this.
