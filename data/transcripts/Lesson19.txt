 Writing scripts can feel like one of the most daunting stages of creation, but in reality it's no different than the conversations we have with one another every single day. You may not feel like you need to write a script, but even if you're just creating a 15 second TikTok, it needs to follow some type of story. In this lesson, I'm going to break down my technique and make the process as fun and natural as possible. By the time you're finished this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding and all of the tools you need to write a compelling script that your audience will relate to. We're going to cover creating the right environment, seeking inspiration, becoming the character, and how to read to succeed. That's the lesson plan. Now let's get started. Writing is my personal favorite step in the creation process. It's your opportunity to really feel into the story you're trying to tell. The way it works here at One Peak is usually like this. BrainStorm and conceptualize a core idea and story as a team, and then take that concept and write it out into a full narrative on my own, before bringing it back to the team to fine tune together. You already have that big idea and a general storyline, so you're ready to write, but there are a few things to consider before we even put pen to paper to ensure your writing session is successful. Starting with our surroundings, creating the right environment. I find writing to be an incredibly personal experience, so I work best in an environment free from any distractions with some gentle focus music on, so I can get my head down and find a flow state. It's probably going to be different for everyone, so I would just recommend experimenting with a few different options, but focus on these key elements. Number one, find your time. The time of day in which you choose to write will have a massive impact on how it turns out. Find out on your habits from the creative mindset module and search for a time you know you'll be full of creative energy and ready to write. Personally, at the end of a long workday filled with thousands of decisions, I find that I don't have the brain power required to write anything worth reading, so I like to write first thing in the morning, usually after a workout so my body and mind are wide awake and ready to rip. This could be completely different for you. I know some people write best just before bed when they've had a moment to reflect on their day and really feel into all of their emotions. Try writing at various times throughout the day to start and when you find a time that clicks, make that your writing block. Number two, create your space. Another important factor when it comes to writing is your physical surroundings. Find an area where you're comfortable and enjoy spending time. It's also helpful to have inspirational surroundings so that when you take a break to look up from your work, you have visual cues that keep your brain moving. Personally, I find working next to a window to be helpful with this, so I can occasionally peek out at the world going by and let my mind wander. Number three, dial it in. The final step in creating the right space is fine tuning your environment. Remove any distractions that will pull you out of your flow state. Put your devices on do not disturb. Put on some noise canceling headphones to drown out any unwanted sounds. I would also highly recommend trying bignyral beats for focus. They're basically just gentle soundscapes that play in your subconscious and help you focus. I'll link my favorite playlist in the description below. And if there's anyone else around, let them know not to bug you for the next 30 minutes. You'll be surprised at how much you can get done in a small amount of highly focused time. Okay, now you're in a place where you can focus. You have your laptop or notebook out and you're ready to start writing. But nothing's coming out. You're staring at the blank page. Blanking. Waiting for a word. Even a letter. But nothing is coming. So how do you start? This can be the most challenging part of writing. But once you're able to get over that initial block, the thoughts usually start flowing pretty easily. So here's what you can do. Seek inspiration. Whenever I find myself low on creative juices, I turn to other creators for Enzbo. Whether you're writing a five minute monologue, a story about a princess, or a script for how to bake cookies, there are thousands of people who've done it before and can help you get your thoughts moving. Start by searching videos that align with what you're trying to create. From there, just watch three or four examples and take notes. What was their intro? Instead they transition into the main topic. Did they use any rhyme schemes or a letteration that felt catchy or stuck with you? How did you relate to them? Take this information and use it to inform your own story. Now that you're feeling inspired, the final step before really getting everything out onto that page is this. Become the character. In order to write a captivating script, you have to make it feel believable and relatable. This starts with understanding your character. Even if that character is just yourself, think about what makes you relatable. What challenges are you going through that others can sympathize with? What successes are you having that viewers will find inspirational? Determine your character traits for this story and then use them to guide you as you begin writing. This will also inform the writing style you use. If your character isn't poetic, you probably shouldn't write a poem. Use your character voice to determine the style of writing you use. As a content creator, most of the time it's going to be coming from either a first person perspective, which means speaking directly to your audience. Here's an example. I'm George Pino Bucco and we're going to see how much preview we can get in exchange for a video. Hopefully at least one. Or as a narrative, which is telling a story. Here's an example of that as well. From here you'll follow the story arc we covered previously and guide your character from the initial intro all the way up to the star moment and finally the summary. This can be done in as few as 50 words or as many as 5,000. As long as you follow the story arc and keep things interesting. Once you start writing, get as much as you can onto paper and try to summarize your story in a rough first draft. Then you're ready for the final step. Read to succeed. This final step of the writing process will actually probably take place a few times as you read and reiterate your work. The point of this step is to read through your story and make changes as you come across points that don't feel like they flow well. These are your first draft. We'll have a lot of areas for improvement. I know mine do. So start by reading through the script by yourself, adjusting as you go. Do this on your own a couple of times until you feel like you have something that's worth sharing. Then from there, take it to your first audience for feedback. But there's something very important to note that I've learned from years of refining this process. When you spend this much time on something and pour so much of your emotion and thought into it, it begins to feel very personal. When you're writing with someone for the first time can be an extremely vulnerable experience. And to be honest, I still get nervous sharing my first draft. But I want you to remember this. The feedback you receive is not a reflection of you. Try your best not to take it personally and use the information you get to refine your work. Just because people have suggestions doesn't mean you wrote a bad story. It just means you have an opportunity to make it better and more relatable for your audience. That part is going to take a lot of work and years of practice. I'll let you know when I've perfected it. Now that you're able to review your work objectively, get feedback from people close to you. Whether that be your teammates, coworkers, friends, or family, consolidate their feedback and use it to refine your work. In this stage, you'll want to remove anything that doesn't move the story forward. Get rid of the fluff. Repeat this process until you have something you're proud of. And then you're ready to add the cherry on top that will ensure your viewers stick around to hear every last second of your story. And that is the hook. Let's move on to the next lesson and get started.
