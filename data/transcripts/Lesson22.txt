 Welcome to the next module, pre-production. Pre-production is the planning phase of content creation, where you will solidify all of the details of your project before the camera start rolling. The goal here is to leave you feeling more organized and prepared as you head into your shoot day. This may not be the most glamorous side of your role as a content creator, but it is, however, a wildly important step and should not be skipped. Hilarious heartthrob and actor Ryan Reynolds want shared some words of wisdom on the subject and they have always stuck with me. Don't expect success, prepare for it. I wholeheartedly believe that preparation is the key to success and should be a no-excuse mandatory step in every creator's process. So in this module, we're going to walk through the video fundamentals and why they're important to understand. We're also going to share the importance of storyboarding and help you create one of your own. And finally, we're going to show you how we write out a shot list for every project to ensure nothing gets missed. If you can commit to adding these key elements to your process, I promise you are going to feel more confident hitting that record button on your shoot day. All right, let's get to it.
