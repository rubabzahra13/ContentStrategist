 Now that you've learned everything you need to know about product landing pages, let's talk about service-based offers. Whether you're a mobile pet groomer, financial planner, or handyman, you solve a problem that your customer doesn't have the time, knowledge, or desire to solve for themselves. A lot of the time your customers are already actively aware of this problem and may even be currently searching for the solution. So when they find you and your service, you need to quickly and efficiently assure them that they are in the right place. That's exactly what we're about to do. So strap in and let's get after it. Most service landing pages have one primary aim. To collect high-quality leads that convert into customers. Unlike product pages, a service offer is typically a bit more specific to the customers needs and it probably requires a personalized sales or educational touchpoint before your customer hands over the cash. So while product pages optimize for direct sales conversion, we're going to be optimizing for lead generation. I'm going to start with a super quick overview of how that will look and then dive into each individual section to provide a little bit more detail. Here's our service based landing page template. The very top is going to be the offer headline. Followed by a basic form fill for lead generation, then the types of service options or how it works section, followed by social proof, a condensed story of why you exist and who you serve, then finally a very direct CTA or called action. I should mention that you may also want to include additional CTA buttons at each step of this landing page, but the last one will be the most clear and enticing. Okay, now that we've done the overview, let's break it down section by section, starting with the offer headline. This is where you promise your customer their desired outcome as briefly and convincingly as possible. We already covered a lot of this in our offer creation lesson, so if you haven't watched that yet, I would highly suggest doing that now. For the purpose of this lesson, I'm going to use an example from a well-established cleaning company in the UK called GLEAM. Their offer is unlock your free time with brilliant local cleaners. It's short, concise, and tells me exactly what they offer cleaning services, who will fulfill the service, brilliant local cleaners, and why I should do it to get my time back. Now for the next step, our form fill. You want to make this as easy as possible for your customer while making sure you get all of the relevant information. For GLEAM cleaning, that looks like this. What kind of cleaning are you looking for with a drop down including three different options? What is your email? And what is your number? To complete the form, they have a CTA button that says book now. If this were my cleaning company, I would probably try a different tax variation like get a free quote, so it feels less committal. Reading book now as a customer makes me feel as though I'll need to make a payment, and to be honest, I'm not convinced this is the company I want to hire just yet. So get a free quote, still feels like I'm doing research without making a final decision. This form can obviously be extremely basic for a simple low ticket offer like a cleaning service. However, if the service you offer is more complicated and expensive, you may want to include additional fields to understand if your potential customer has the time and money required to book your service. That way, your pre-qualifying leads and don't end up wasting your time following up with customers who aren't a fit for your offer. Most site builders will have a plug-and-play form fill where you can create as many custom fields as you like. You can also integrate a third-party plug-in like type form if you want to get more advanced data and sort leads automatically. The section right below that will be a how it works section. Here's where you can help the customer understand exactly what their onboarding and delivery experience will look and feel like. They can begin to visualize the entire process and make a well-informed decision to buy. This is a great section to talk about your value propositions and why your service is the best. Are you faster, easier, or more fun than your competitors? Show and tell them what to expect from working with you in a way that gives them clarity and gets them excited. This is a great section to include imagery or icons to add context and really help them see how you do what you do. Then comes the social proof section. Do you have a bunch of Google or Trust Pilot reviews? Maybe some screenshots of text conversations with happy clients? Were you ever featured in some type of media for all of the work that you do? Use anyone or all of these pieces of social proof to show your audience that you are trustworthy. Herd mentality goes a long way here. If your customer sees a lot of people like them raving about their experience, there's a damn good chance that will be the breaking point where they decide they want in too. This is a great spot to include an additional CTA button to learn more, book consultation, or whatever other action helps get you closer to converting them into a paying customer. After your social proof, you have an opportunity to make it personal with your story. Remember that you have a human on the other side of the screen and we naturally resonate with great storytelling. Maybe you can talk about how you once felt stuck in the position that they are currently in and you couldn't find the right help. So you decided to learn to do it yourself and have been able to help 10,000 people just like you change their lives since then. This is a great spot for a consolidated sales letter. I've included a link to one of the greatest sales letters of all time in the lesson description to give you some inspiration. Finally, we have our last call to action. This is where you want to be as clear and direct as possible while giving them an offer that's impossible to refuse. For a cleaning company, it could look like this. Book your home clean today and we'll do the bathrooms free. You don't have to add in a bonus, but it's a great way to create urgency and get people motivated to click. A different way you could create urgency and scarcity here is by creating a limited time window. For example, book now, get your house clean tomorrow. Oftentimes when people are looking for service, they're looking because they want it done quickly and adding this promise might just be enough to push them over the edge and book right away. That's it for our service landing page. Up next, you're going to learn how to create a listicle style landing page. This type of landing page has been known to double conversion, so it's definitely worth sticking around for. Take it away, Meg.
