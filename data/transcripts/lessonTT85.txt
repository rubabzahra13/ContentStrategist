 In this lesson, I'm going to show you our process for how to actually create the course from scripting to shooting. Once you have your offer locked down, it's time to create a wireframe. We like to create a list of everything that we need to teach our students for them to make the transformation. Then we put that list into the order that they should learn it in. For example, it doesn't make sense to teach someone how to edit a video before teaching them how to shoot it. After we order it, we group the related bullet points together that can go into the same lesson. These are going to be your lesson outlines that you can use to build out your scripts. Finally, you can put lessons into modules, which are like categories or folders for your lessons to go into. For example, this course has a module called the funnel and sales process. Inside that, we have lessons on email strategy, the steps in our funnel, and how to use kajabi. We like to use Google Drive for creating all our courses because it's great to keep everything organized, but you can also use services like Trello, Notion, or even the Notes app on your computer if you're more comfortable with that. Once you have your list of lessons and bullet points on what each one is going to include, you're ready to get into scripting. Now, the goal in scripting a course is to get people from A to B in as little time and effort as humanly possible. The more clear and concise you can make the transformation for people, the better experience they're going to have. Don't make the mistake of thinking that your course becomes more valuable because you have 90 lessons and 30 hours of content. Remember, don't give them a yacht when they really need a speedboat. If you're teaching someone how to build a house, 90 lessons might be the necessary and shortest amount of time possible to make the transformation. But if you're teaching them how to knit a scarf, you have completely overdone it. Our main course, teaching people how to get millions of views on social media, was 8 lessons, and less than 2 hours. But students still had life-changing transformations, like billions of views, and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Creating courses this way is also going to stop you from spending 2 years creating a course before realizing that nobody wants it. If you truly are an expert at what you're teaching, it should be second nature, and you should be able to script your drafts in a few days of focus dedicated work. Then spend your time removing the fluff and making it as concise as possible. Keep in mind that you can add to the course later on if you get a lot of feedback that there's something missing, or something stopping people from achieving the transformation. We also try to write all of our courses at a grade 3 level. When people are learning new ideas, they need it to be as simple as possible. You need to remember that things that are obvious to you as the expert might be completely new to the students. Something that's also really important to remember with AI coming out is chatGPT can be amazing at helping you brainstorm the wireframe, or what should be in the course, but when it comes to the actual scripting, it's going to sound super robotic if you just let chatGPT do the scripts for you. In my opinion, if you want to make the course as impactful as possible, the actual scripts should come from your voice, but do remember that chatGPT can be amazing for brainstorming. Once you're done, you'll want to have someone who's not an expert on the subject, read through all of your scripts and make sure that it makes sense. Get some help from a friend or family member who will give you genuine honest feedback, especially if they're willing to give you brutal feedback. Something to remember is that some people are visual learners, while others learn better by actually doing. That's why we love adding exercises and PDFs to help people with different learning styles. Now, let's talk about the actual creation process. We used to run a video production company, so we have hundreds of thousands of dollars in production gear in our house, collecting dust, and it's easy for us to pull out, but it's completely unnecessary to create a great course. Chances are you would be finding just as much impact in the things that we're saying if we weren't beautifully lit and with a nice background. I've seen course creators do millions of dollars with just their webcam and a simple slideshow, so I'm going to give you a range of options for the production process. Number one is high production. I'm going to show you what that looks like. So we have a cinema camera. In our case, it's a Canon C70, but you can use literally any camera. Then we have a teleprompter. This is the cheapest one we could find on Amazon. I think it's like between one to $200 and we have an iPad that sits here and runs this app, which just plays the script at a set pace. You could also hire a local videographer to do this for you, but if you want to learn more about how we light, shoot, or edit high production videos, there's a link in the description to check out the content creator Academy, where we dive deep into all of our gear and how to make videos look and sound as good as possible. Option number two is phone production. For a lower budget version of this setup, there's smartphone apps like this one here, which plays a teleprompter on the screen while recording video with the selfie camera. Here's what that looks like, so you can get a feel for the quality difference. Obviously, it looks a lot different, but all of the information and the value is going to be exactly the same. So in my opinion, you can get away with doing this quality No problem. If you are going to go that route, I recommend doing it in front of a window so that you can get the best light on your face possible. It's not totally necessary and some people just do in their office, but since this course will live forever and people are going to spend a lot of time watching it, you might as well put some time into making it look as nice as possible. Also, if you want to improve the audio, you can get wireless mics to make it sound better than iPhone audio. I put links in the description to the mics as well as the tripod that we use if you're going to go this route. Finally, option number three is a screen recording or a slide show. I've seen course creators who make millions of dollars by screen recording a PowerPoint presentation on their computer and just talking through it. On Mac computers, this is as easy as holding command, shift, and five to record your screen. And if you're on a PC, you can use quick time. If you're not sure how to do that, just give it a quick Google. It's super easy. This is also ideal if you're teaching people how to use programs on the computer. For example, we use this method when teaching editing tutorials. To take it to the next level, you can also add a little bubble in the corner of the screen walking through the content. You can do that by setting up your phone and recording yourself at the same time as you're recording your screen. If you do decide to go this route, make sure you do something so that you can match up your screen recording with the camera footage. For example, I'll usually start by saying I'm clicking tabs in three, two, one, click. Then I can see the tab change on the screen recording. Here are the moments that I press the mouse in the video and line the two up. Makes it a little easier. So to recap, start by creating a wireframe with everything that you're going to teach in bullet points, then separate it into lessons. Then script your lessons as concisely as you can to help students get from A to B as quickly and easily as possible. And finally, film your course either the high production method, low production method, or using screen recordings. All right, in the next lesson, we're going to be showing you the fastest and easiest way to edit course content, no matter which method you're using to create it. I will see you over there.
