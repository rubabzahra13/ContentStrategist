 This lesson is going to be comically short because this is an incredibly simple transition, but it's super fun, super effective, so I thought it should be included, and that is the lens cover, which looks something like this. The lens cover. You can use your hands, but I prefer things like towels or hats. Now, if it looks simple, that's because it is. Essentially, all you're doing is at the end of the first shot, you're covering the lens with something, and at the beginning of the next shot, you're uncovering the lens with something else. This was made popular with people just covering the lens with their hand in the first shot, and then uncovering it with their hand in the next shot, which to me is the boring way of doing this, but the possibilities for this transition are absolutely endless. So we're going to hop into the timeline, and I'm going to show you what this looks like with a towel and a hat. So in shot number one, we have Meg coming out of Asana. At the end of the shot, she whips the towel up. We're going to go through frame by frame so you can see. And right here, the towel covers the lens, and in the next frame, we're going to have her holding a hat out in front of her and putting it on her head. So I'm going to show you what this looks like when you play it all through. Really seamless, really nice, and super, super simple. This is going to be an extremely short tutorial because there's nothing more to it, but I want you to really think outside the box with this transition and try to think how you can do it with objects or things that people wouldn't expect. One thing, just like the last video that you can do to take this to the next level is add a Wush, which I will add here, depending on what the objects are that you're using to cover the lens, you can add different sound effects to match. So for example, for the towel, it might be nice to have like a cloth Wush, something like this, but use your own imagination for whatever it is you're using to cover up the lens. If you do use this transition, drop it in the Facebook group and I would love to see how you decided to creatively take it to the next level and I will see you in the next one.
